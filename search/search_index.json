Birds of a feather flocking together phenomena.</p> <p>For a client to want to get something handled, they must have something they know they really want to get handled.</p> <p>Therefore the first step is profiling the client.  This will bring to view the following:</p> <ol> <li>AN EXTREME BAD CONDITION OR LOW LEVEL OF EXISTENCE.</li> </ol> <p>This is a low Red Zone level of existence.  It includes poverty, bankruptcy, depression, personal dishonesty, no self worth, low self esteem, broken-hearts, immobility, terror, failure, etc., etc.</p> <p>Behind this sits the following:</p> <ol> <li>AN AREA OF BLACKNESS.  (Red Zone, level of existence Absence.)</li> </ol> <p>Contains heavy areas of fear of pain, abuse, dishonesty, false answers and terror of being wrong or being made wrong.</p> <ol> <li> <p>AN AREA OF STUPIDITY.  (Red Zone, level of existence Chaos.) Contains heavy areas of abusive false and wrong answers that are locked in painful abusive episodes of teaching, training or educational life incidents.  These false or wrong answers have been forced to be believed due to the threat of punishment or abuse if you do not know what you are studying by Abusive authorities, teachers or parents.</p> </li> <li> <p>AN AREA OF CONFUSION.  (Red Zone, level of existence Chaos.)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Contains recognition of abusive dishonesties of self and others, plus recognition of areas of having engaged in producing abusive wrongnesses, falseness and betrayals of trust, without knowing how to correct and atone for the abusiveness and the damage created by that abuse.</p> <ol> <li>STUCK IN A SHOCK.  (Red Zone, level of existence Absence.)</li> </ol> <p>Areas of shock and the technology of handling, are covered in earlier bulletins and tapes.</p> <ol> <li>STUCK IN A HUGE UPSET.  (Red Zone, all levels.)</li> </ol> <p>An upset comes in many forms, but an upset is primarily a form of electronic spiritual explosion or implosion.  As an explosion, it disintegrates the being and its creations, driving the being out and away from the area they are occupying.  (The being cannot get back into the area.) As an implosion, the being and its creations disintegrate and the area collapses over the being and buries it under the rubble of its former creations.  (The being is completely disintegrated, trapped and submerged in the area.)</p> <ol> <li>OPERATING ON A HUGE NEGATIVE PROGRAM.(Red Zone, all levels.)</li> </ol> <p>The being has decided that people and life are evil and bad.  All education is perverted into a negative experience.  The being superimposes negative precepts and pictures over people, places, subjects and things.</p> <ol> <li>HAS EVERYONE AS THEIR ENEMY.(Psychic warfare, Red Zone, all levels.)</li> </ol> <p>In this state people are not interested in truth or effectiveness, they are dedicated to finding someone to blame for their condition or level of existence.</p> <p>It is from this point upward, from 8 to 1, that your client is constantly in the Red Zone.</p> <p>They are being created as a chronic losing negative identity constantly getting and giving UNWANTED WANTS.</p> <ol> <li>IS BURIED IN PAIN AND UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS.  (Low Yellow and Red Zone, all levels.)</li> </ol> <p>Fear is the predominant emotion and attitude of this state of being.  This shows up as an immobilizing, overwhelming fear of success, prosperity, work, winning, cold calling, prospecting, leadership and people handling reluctances.</p> <ol> <li>AN ABUSIVE EPISODE.  (You were given what you did not want, or something happened you did not want, producing an Alien UNWANTED WANT or OBJECT.  Red Zone, all levels.)</li> </ol> <p>At this point life begins to become a grim ordeal and is filled with tedium, your client begins to lose big time at the games of life.</p> <ol> <li>KARMIC TELEPATHIC SELECTION OF AN ABUSER OR GANG OF ABUSERS TO PUNISH THEMSELVES.  (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.) By instigating self-determined changes, the being is compulsively attracted to AN ABUSER or ABUSIVE situation.</li> </ol> <p>This is the point the being gives up control of their own universe and goes on someone else\u2019s time trail, someone else\u2019s space, someone else\u2019 s energy or money, someone else\u2019s objects.</p> <p>The being has failed at being ethical, and believes they do not deserve to own their own universe.  The only answer is to give up control and be punished by An Abuser for failing and betrayal.</p> <p>This is how the law of KARMA comes into being.</p> <p>The law of KARMA is the universal spiritual ETHICS and JUSTICE self-enforced and self-disciplined, SYSTEM of PRINCIPLES having been created and AGREED UPON by and for spiritual beings to be able to maintain an HONOR based ETHICS and JUSTICE SYSTEM.</p> <p>This spiritual ETHICS and JUSTICE SYSTEM demands that you, the being, will utilize your psychic powers to fully penalize or punish yourself when you have violated your own Basic Goodness, Codes, Principles, Virtues and Integrity.</p> <p>Or:</p> <p>You will fully utilize your psychic powers to fully reward and enhance yourself when you have honored your Basic Goodness, Honesty, Codes, Principles, Virtues and Integrity.</p> <ol> <li>THE FURIES, PERSONAL TURMOIL, PANIC AND CONFUSION.  (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.)</li> </ol> <p>The being is devastated and furious at itself for having violated their Codes, Virtues, Principles and Integrity.</p> <p>The being has enormous feelings of guilt, fear of being found out, worry, nervousness, loss of self respect, lack of self worth and betrayal.</p> <p>By committing harmful acts and having secrets from those who have trusted the client, the client realizes they have betrayed the trust of their friends, partners and family.</p> <p>The being is desperate to solve and escape from these turmoils, guilts and feelings of having betrayed those who have trusted or loved them.</p> <p>To solve and handle their furies, conflicts, turmoil, guilt, etc., the being decides to do something to stop themselves from violating their Codes, Virtues, Principles, and Integrity by creating self-determined changes in their life.</p> <p>Such self-determined changes as:</p> <p>To go on a diet.</p> <p>To change jobs.</p> <p>To end a relationship.</p> <p>To get married.</p> <p>To get divorced.</p> <p>To join a religious group.</p> <p>To become a nun.</p> <p>To sell.</p> <p>To buy.</p> <p>To invest.</p> <p>To go bankrupt.</p> <p>To move to another country.</p> <p>Etc., Etc.</p> <p>All self determined changes are preceded by the furies, turmoil, confusion, senses of guilt, feelings of betrayal, violations of trusts.</p> <ol> <li> <p>KEPT HIDDEN THEIR HARMFUL ACTS.  (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.)</p> </li> <li> <p>FAILURE, INCOMPETENCE, PRODUCING HARMFUL OR NO PRODUCTS, NO WANTS.  (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.)</p> </li> <li> <p>COMMITS HARMFUL ACTS THAT VIOLATE THEIR CODES, PRINCIPLES AND INTEGRITY.  (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.)</p> </li> <li> <p>PRETENSE, PRETENDING TO KNOW.  (Yellow or Red Zone.)</p> </li> </ol> <p>It is from this point, 17 backwards to 1, that will cause your client to begin to fail at the games of life.</p> <ol> <li>COLLIDES WITH AREAS OF NON-COMPREHENSION, LACK OF TRUTH, KNOWLEDGE, TECHNOLOGY, SKILL OR ABILITY.  (Yellow Zone.)</li> </ol> <p>This is the most vital point in TIME and SPACE.  It is where your client can either succeed or fail.</p> <p>Your client\u2019s future PROSPERITY, SUCCESS and HAPPINESS, depends entirely on whether they are fully ROLE EDUCATED on THE TECHNOLOGY of HOW to ATTAIN and MAINTAIN PROSPERITY, SUCCESS and HAPPINESS.</p> <p>Over the forty years in this field, spanning an excess of 500,000 people, the most omitted training step on all people is: How to Attain and Handle PROSPERITY.</p> <p>If a client or student has been disintegrated by an ABUSER and has been created as a loser or failure, it does not matter how well you educate, train or process them, they will end up involuntarily, compulsively creating a losing and failing life situation, on the edge of, or deeply in POVERTY AND SADNESS.</p> <ol> <li> <p>LIFE GOING FAIRLY WELL, OCCASIONAL ATTAINMENT OF WANTS. (Low Green or Yellow Zone levels of existence.)</p> </li> <li> <p>LIFE GOING GREAT, CONSISTENT ATTAINMENT OF YOUR CLIENT\u2019S AND OTHERS\u2019 WANTS.  (High Green Zone levels of existence.)</p> </li> <li> <p>IN ACTION, IN THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, FOLLOWING THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGED MASTER PLAN.  (High Green Zone.)</p> </li> <li> <p>CREATES A MASTERFUL WINNING IDENTITY.  (High Green Zone.)</p> </li> <li> <p>CREATES A FULL HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGED MASTER PLAN.

(High Green Zone.)</p> </li> <li> <p>KNOW WITH FULL HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGERY WHAT THEY AND OTHERS REALLY WANT.  (High Green Zone.)</p> </li> <li> <p>HAS A HUGE HOLOGRAPHIC DREAM THAT MASSIVELY DOES THE GREATEST GOOD FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER, ABUNDANTLY GIVING AND PRODUCING WHAT ARE THE TRUE HOLOGRAPHIC WANTS.  (High Green Zone.)</p> </li> </ol> <p>The being\u2019s dreams, intentions, goals or purposes act as the being\u2019s WILL POWER, and are the most basic power source and directional focus of spiritual forces and psychic powers of the Spiritual Being in order to fully attain the HOLOGRAPHIC WANTS.</p> <ol> <li>HOLOGRAPHICALLY CREATED WANT.  (Gold Zone.)</li> </ol> <p>The holographic WANT stems from the truth, knowledge and love obtained as a result of having applied full spiritual permeation into what needs to be accurately perceived in an optimum or non-optimum area.</p> <p>This area has been holographically permeated and perceived in its entirety of its energy, matter, space, time, mood, form, condition, level of existence, its operating responsibilities and consequences.</p> <p>The WANT is what is needed to upgrade or destroy the non-optimum area.</p> <p>The WANT creates the desire, drive and intention to have a game.</p> <p>Anything that impedes, slows, misdirects, prevents or stops the attainment of the wants, dreams, intentions, goals or purposes of the Spiritual Being robs the being of power, direction and focus, thus robbing the being of its chances of fully attaining those wants, dreams, intentions, goals or purposes.</p> <p>Rehabilitation of a Spiritual Being\u2019s wants, dreams, intentions, goals and purposes are the MOST VITAL PROCESSING ACTIONS you can implement towards fully handling the being\u2019s case, plus restoring the being\u2019s Codes, Virtues, Principles and Integrity.</p> <ol> <li>AN OPTIMUM OR NON-OPTIMUM AREA, SUBJECT, THING, OBJECT, PLACE OR PERSON THAT NEEDS TO BE SPIRITUALY FULLY PERMEATED AND PERCEIVED.

The ability to approximate as  closely as possible the Knowledge, truth,  know-how, action, skill, object, datum, or word  in its same time and space, with its same mass or energy</p> <p>DUPLICATION: noun,  1. The act or procedure of  duplicating. 2. The ability to approximate as  closely as possible the skill, object, datum,  word in its same time and space, with its same mass or energy.</p> <p>DUPLICATING: verb,  The action of making an identical copy.</p> <p>DUPLICATION, MENTAL:  This is an exact mental  representation in mental image picture form.  It  is recorded and stored in the mental machine  known as the mind and contains all the  perceptics, creations, shapes, events, forms,  precepts, opinions, and conclusions.  This mental  imagery is data and is a valuable tool as such,  but it contains no intelligence or worthwhile  judgment, which can come only from the spiritual Being.</p> <p>DUPLICATION, IDENTITY:  n.  An identity is what  the spiritual being creates to take and hold a  position in order to play a game, consequently  the identity has very selective perceptions and  selective duplications. The identity is usually  only willing to duplicate what is inside the game  box and gets very agitated if forced to duplicate what is outside the box.</p> <p>DUPLICATION, ARTIFICIAL IDENTITY:  n.  An  artificial identity is what others have created  the spiritual being into to take and hold a  humanoid position in order to play a humanoid  game, consequently the artificial identity has  almost no perceptions and duplications other than  what another or others approves of. The identity  is usually only willing to duplicate what they  have been programmed for and is okayed or  approved of by others. The artificial identity is  usually well inside the humanoid game box and  gets very agitated and often goes into a trance  state if forced to duplicate the higher levels of the humanoid box.</p> <p>DUPLICATION, PHYSICAL UNIVERSE:  n.  The act or  procedure of making an identical copy of an  original using exactly the same formula, same  material, similar time, with similar who, similar  what, similar where, similar when, similar why,  similar how, similar mood, similar space, similar  form, similar energy, similar particles, similar  feelings, similar motions, similar heat, similar  cold, their interactions and interdependences and  consequences.  It is the physical replication, or  physical copying of the original over and over.</p> <p>DUPLICATION, SPIRITUAL:  n.  This is an exact  three dimensional recreation of someone or  something that is an additional creation of that  someone or something with its own who, what,  where, when why, how, mood, space, time, form,  energy, particles, feelings, motions, heat, cold,  their interactions and interdependences and consequences.</p> <p>This additional exact three dimensional creation  is what allows for vanishment because it releases  the being from the scarcity of only one and  allows the Being the recognition that they can  create, own, and be responsible for what has been  created, thus bring about the power of choice  whether to keep it created or cease to create it  or create an unlimited amount of what they want.</p> <p>PERMEATE:  v.  1. To spread or flow throughout,  pervade.  2. To spread; penetrate; diffuse.  3.  To flow through and penetrate every particle of  the who, what, where, when, how and mood levels  of an area of life with knowledge, truth, love,  awareness and all spiritual virtues.</p> <p>PERMEATION:   The spiritual ability to experience  and totally duplicate, recreate, own, be  responsible for, and control, as well as be at  one with the exact who, what, where, when, why,  how, mood, and their interactions and interdependences and consequences.</p> <p>By being able to permeate fully, one achieves the  highest level of perfect holographic duplication,  thus one simultaneously experiences the 10  attributes of greatness: Presence, Creation,  Love, Truth, Harmony, Knowledge, Value, Responsibility, Control and Integrity.</p> <p>ALAN C.

For most it is easier to attack the person  helping them than it is to confront a BLACK CORE  INCIDENT. The reason for this is that in a BLACK  CORE INCIDENT the being completely loses itself.</p> <p>They will of course protest the person helping  them is trying to take them over or wants to own  them or some other garbage. This gives them the excuse to run away.</p> <p>What they are really running away from is their  immense hatred of themselves and their deep  seated hatred for other beings, they are into a very heavy restraint of self.</p> <p>For a BLACK CORE INCIDENT contains the most  incredible amount of hatred\u2026.hatred for self and  hatred for others, especially those with power.  (This is why there are so few processors in the  world\u2026.they have collided with the self-hatred of  themselves and the self-hatred of most beings.)</p> <p>Continuous poverty, disestablishment, divorce,  bad relationships, failure, stupidity,  illiteracy, inability to arrive and unhappiness  all stem from an activated BLACK CORE INCIDENT.</p> <p>It appears a being deliberately keeps the BLACK  CORE INCIDENT in place to restrain their own power.</p> <p>There is nothing unusual in this, it is the being  honoring its own basic honesty, goodness and  integrity. The being knows it is not capable of  having and honoring true power, so stops itself  from Being \u2013 Doing \u2013 and Having in the present.</p> <p>As the being approaches a BLACK CORE INCIDENT the  being fears they will lose themselves again, of  course they have already lost. The self they are  hanging onto is a composite of rightnesses and  unusual solutions designed to make an approximation of self exist.</p> <p>The being will deliberately destroy its  connections to power if it is engaged in  dishonorable actions. Of course it will always  blame and accuse the being in power of what it is  in actuality its own harmful acts.  (Attacking  that which their survival depends on.)</p> <p>The being will have an Up-the-Pole Ascension  Experience as they go free from the area they are  committing continuous harmful acts in, but then  the non-optimum reality and poverty life conditions will set in.</p> <p>The being will not recognize these non-optimum  realities and poverty life conditions as they are  being too right about everything, they will in  fact be addicted to Ascension Experiences and  their favorite solution to everything.</p> <p>You can easily believe that other practices and  religions have discovered the above but it is not  true, they are in fact dramatizing not looking at  and denying the existence of this area and the  Ascension/Abuser/Abuse Addiction phenomena.</p> <p>Due to this discovery we are completely  revamping, re-evaluating and reformatting the  approach and the sequence of doing the  Ascension/Abuser/Abuse Addiction Procedure.</p> <p>ALAN  C.

This drops the E-Motion tone level.</p> <p>A may be low toned and B is high toned the same occurs.</p> <p>As a Being takes more and more charge off, the message  line and message particles are more complete and 3DH.</p> <p>Each E-Motional tone level could be said to be an input  or outflow carrier line.</p> <p>Content does not really matter, what is important is the tone level of the A\u2019s or B\u2019s. For they alone monitor the  quality flow of the message particles.</p> <p>At a 3DH level, it requires 3DH point A\u2019s and 3DH point B\u2019s.</p> <p>For what is travelling along these 3DH lines? Force, Charge,  Mass that is holographically formulated to represent the message.</p> <p>Key in\u2019s destroy the size and quality of the A\u2019s or B\u2019s. The  more highly charged the point A or point B, the less Force,  Charge or Mass can be confronted or handled. This brings about  an inadvertant witholding of self or lessening of powers.</p> <p>In the case of LRH\u2019s 3DH comm line from him to me, something  keyed him in, I have a pretty good idea what it was, it was in  the area of his relationship with MSH. </p> <p>He withdrew off the line and put a non 3DH substitute in his place, so began my descent.</p> <p>When the CMO and Miscavage took over the CofS, an immediate drop  of 3DH occured. Those who were telepathic could read their pictures, the schism occured.</p> <p>Forget all the blame, shame, regret, it was the absence of the  acceptable 3DH telepathically projected imagery.</p> <p>The CMO and Miscavage, Starkey, et al, are very poorly trained,  hatted or audited Beings, they are incapable of projecting the  dreams, goals or wants of LRH, or duplicate our dreams, goals  or wants.</p> <p>They became enforcers of their wants. (Abusers.) The 3DH agreements  were violated, tens of thousands walked away in disgust.</p> <p>For us and much of society they became and are a destructive, unwanted point B.</p> <p>All unwanted bad conditions on a case can be traced to these  3DH lines and terminal collapses.</p> <p>All failed goals, loss of dreams, yes even heartbreak  has at its center the loss of 3DH mock-ups. It is no so  much the loss of the terminal that sticks a Being in a loss, as it is the loss of the 3DH mock-ups. Restore the 3DH  mock-ups and the Being will again be happy.</p> <p>When a Being has an AE, the Being becomes huge, the power,  force, charge and solidity of his mock-ups are immense. How  long the Being can maintain that AE state depends solely on  who can receive those giant mock-ups. Lack of receipt point  B\u2019s will cause the AEed Being to crash and burn.</p> <p>Often losing the ability to 3DH at that time. His postulates  or mock-ups will not stick as he is now the self unmocker.</p> <p>Good, consistent processing, training and hatting are required  to maintain the 3DH state in this universe. Being connected to  other 3DH level Beings is mandatory.</p> <p>There is a lot more to this.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw14.html","title":"3DH Areas","text":"<p>3<sup>rd</sup> Dimensional Holographic creation and communication is a fairly vast subject, I cover a fair bit of it in  my book\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s in Disguise and \u201cThe Paradigm Matrix.\u201d</p> <p>To operate knowingly requires comprehension of 3 areas.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Being.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Physical Universe.</p> </li> </ol> <p>E.

Many of the presentations have been at international conferences, so there were participants that came from many nations, cultures, ethnicities, backgrounds, and philosophies.</p> <p>At each conference, I observed that participants took ownership of these virtues and principles as the fundamental causes for the foundation to building a successful, prosperous, and happy life.</p> <p>But what was more astounding to me was that they not only valued these virtues and principles and took ownership, they almost all stated, \u201cI would like to acknowledge your refreshing new presentation of these virtues and principles, as well as getting me to re-inspect and re-evaluate the importances of what I have always known, but had been making less of.  These virtues and principles have always been a part of our culture, our philosophy, and what we value.\u201d</p> <p>Participants from the following countries and their cultures indicated where their virtues and principles were located:</p> <p>England \u2014 Many of the participants claim these virtues and principles are part of their school codes.</p> <p>Malaysia \u2014 Participants stated that these teachings are found in the Koran.</p> <p>Morocco \u2014 Participants claim that these teachings are to be found in all educated families.</p> <p>Portugal \u2014 Several high-level executives stated, \u201cWe have always realized these virtues and principles were of immense value, but your material gave us a practical method of applying and living them.\u201d</p> <p>Spain \u2014 \u201cThis was how our grandparents used to act.\u201d</p> <p>Greece \u2014 \u201cThe great philosophers Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato all taught us these basic, workable virtues and principles.\u201d</p> <p>Japan \u2014 Participants recognized these virtues and principles as also belonging to the teachings of Buddha and the Bushido code of the Samurai.</p> <p>China \u2014 Participants were well aware that the virtues and principles taught were concepts contained within the teachings of Confucius and Mencius.</p> <p>Argentina \u2014 Participants were surprised at how many virtues and principles we used that were part of their cultures.</p> <p>Russia \u2014 Participants exclaimed that was why they had the difficulties that were destroying so many of their cultures.  They had gotten away from these virtues and principles, and that was how the old Russia of eighty years ago believed.</p> <p>India \u2014 Participants were amazed at how our material paralleled the philosophies and wisdom contained in Hinduism, and how the knowledge contained in the Bhagavad-Gita had been brought into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p> <p>Philippines, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Venezuela \u2014 All stated that their countries were all beginning to re-embrace these virtues, principles, and teachings, and that deep down they have always been a vital part of their cultures.</p> <p>Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and the West Indies \u2013 All claimed that their cultures and nations were seeing a re-embracing of these virtues, principles, and teachings and that these are what were the basic foundations of their traditions and character.</p> <p>Europe \u2014 The participants from the many cultures and nations, almost as one, announced that these virtues, principles, and teachings are central to their philosophies and cultures.</p> <p>None of this should really have been so astounding.  After all, I have been a consultant, counselor, teacher, and interviewer of some of the world\u2019s most successful, prosperous, powerful, and knowledgeable leaders, executives, authors, athletes, and mentors for great cultures, philosophies, nations, and individuals, both past and present.</p> <p>My key intentions were to get the true answers of these people to the questions:</p> <p>\u201cWhat has worked consistently for you?</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you value the most?</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the most important virtue for happiness?\u201d</p> <p>After all, I was investigating the people from the most powerful and enduring cultures and philosophies of the world.  That they all shared the identical virtues and principles that were universal, self-evident, and self-empowering concepts.  I would have been more startled had they been different.</p> <p>But the answer to what worked, what was the most valued, the most important universally came down to one answer that towered over all other answers.</p> <p>That answer to what was the most workable, valuable, and important virtue, principle, or attribute for others was HONESTY.</p> <p>The participants agreed that:</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no honor.</p> <p>Without honesty, nothing or no one can be trusted or relied upon.</p> <p>Without honesty, nothing or no one is worthy of power, reward, respect.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no reason to exist, only to pretend.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no one to be friendly and close to, only to be alone or distant.</p> <p>Without honesty, a family is devoid of respect and honor.</p> <p>Without honesty, you are not a person to be relied upon; you are a fraud and to be suspect.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no freedom, just entrapment to your lies.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no truth, only deception.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no decency, only indecency.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure knowledge, only false knowledge.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no purity of spirit, only materialism.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure, true love, only thinly-disguised hate and resentment.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure integrity, only disintegration and individuation.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure Mastery, only incompetence.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure Trust, only distrust.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure Pleasure, only pain.</p> <p>Without honesty, there is no pure Happiness, only depression.</p> <p>What impressed me most about the tens of thousands of people who have answered the above questions is not that they were Japanese, Chinese, Indians, or Americans; they were specific individuals that had the same basic values, dreams, aspirations, and visions about life and the future as we did.</p> <p>If we could increase the honesty level of people, we could be a force for good; and if we could get others to help others to regain their honesty, then we would transcend all religions, philosophies, nationalities, and cultures and make this a much better world.</p> <p>ALAN C.

An unpleasant sensation occurring in varying degrees of severity as a consequence of injury, disease, or emotional disorder.  2.  Suffering or distress.</p> <p>PAIN is composed of: </p> <p>1)  Collapsed universes.  This is the compression of You the spirit, your mind, your body, and your identity into a ball of confusion, stupidity, and electronic energy, trapping You the spirit into heavy uncomfortable feelings and unpleasant sensations of hurt and anxiety. </p> <p>2)  Counter-force.  This is a type of force that is projected by someone or something with the intention of stopping you from attaining your goals, intentions, visions, and objectives.  This can act or manifest as a pressure and can locate anywhere on the body, but especially in the head, thus causing unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>3)  Disruptive imagery.  This is a holographic mental or cellular image that is in conflict with your own imagery, having been stuck or fused spiritually, mentally, or physically into a particular area, place, time, event, or subject.  This disruptive imagery can create severe abrasive frictions, pain, and upset and be a source of unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>4)  Destroyed Creation .  There is always a destroyed creation that has been collapsed by impact or continuous abrasive friction.  Creations are  mental mockups or models that contain long-term future dreams or visions such as a long-term loving partnership or a successful business, etc.  The destroyed creation creates an uncomfortable feeling and unpleasant sensation of a heavy loss.</p> <p>5)  Heat caused by contact, abrasive friction, or impact.  Too much heat causes unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>6)  Cold, which is caused by a vacuum, distance, or low temperature.  Too much cold causes unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>7)  Polarity conflict that is generated by the rapid changing of particles backward and forward from positive to negative polarity in a repeated, violent manner, causing unpleasant sensations. </p> <p>8)  Electricity that is generated by the differing wavelengths of life-force particles impacting or dispersing from an area.  Too much electrical randomness can be extremely uncomfortable.</p> <p>9)  Magnetism.  The constant compulsive or obsessive attraction or repelling of life-force particles and mental imagery into or away from a specific area of abrasive friction or impact.  Too much inward pulling causes sensations of entrapment; too much dispersal causes unpleasant sensations of scatteredness or dispersal.  Either way, your ability to concentrate or focus your attention is greatly diminished.</p> <p>10)  Trapped life-force particles.

The most unpleasant is severe, agonizing hurting such as severe burns, a crushed bone, or torn flesh.  These are physical pains and they emanate extreme uncomfortable feelings and unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>There are four areas of pain.

To successfully navigate upward you often must locate past and present violations of these Codes, Virtues, Integrities, Masteries, Honesty, Truths and Principles.

Their own rightness, their own truth, their own viewpoints, etc., all contained within their translucent bubble.</p> <p>Take the being outside of their bubble and their reality and awareness shifts dramatically.</p> <p>Inside of the bubble the being apparently can create whatever reality they want.</p> <p>I first became aware of this bubble phenomena during world war 2, in London. I was playing cricket one day when a badly, shot up, B29 came hurtling out of the sky and crash landed less than 100 yards away from where I had been standing.</p> <p>It passed directly over my head, I could see the forward turret gunner\u2019s look of horror as the plane approached towards me. It was at that point the translucent bubble became more solid, time appeared to slow down, space appeared to extend, a great calmness came over me, somehow I knew I would survive.</p> <p>The second time was in Lisbon, Portugal, I was staying at a hotel in the center of Lisbon, when in the middle of the night a loud explosion woke me up, I went to the window wondering what had happened, just as I looked out, the building across the road suddenly had a stitching of pock-marks appearing by one across its face, windows exploded in showers of glass, a building further away suddenly dissolved in a thunderous crash. I dived for shelter. Again the bubble effect appeared, again I experienced the same phenomena as the earlier time.</p> <p>Apparently I had put myself right into the middle of a revolution. Definitely a hostile present time!</p> <p>There is a strange sense of \u201cinvincibility\u201d when this bubble effect occurs.</p> <p>Often Ascension Experiences produce \u201cinvincible thoughts.\u201d Very destructive, as they distort present time. The \u201cinvincible thinker\u201d believes they can do no wrong, life has a strange ability to invalidate that form of operation.</p> <p>Later when doing the research into the Ascension Experience phenomena, I began to run into this translucent bubble effect more often. It was constant enough that I put it into all the rundowns. It is even included in the shock handling.</p> <p>All the Presence Processes include this.</p> <p>To comprehend the size and scope of the bubble all you have to do is ask:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Where are you?</p> </li> <li> <p>How big are you?</p> </li> </ul> <p>We start all our sessions with these steps in our model sessions. We do not proceed with the mainline processes until the being is larger than their body, usually at least as large as the processing room. This puts the being immediately into the Green or Gold Zone operating space, from that size spacation they can run their case much faster and much more efficiently.</p> <p>As spacation tends to define beingness, then any trivial or trap type identities are easily spotted and handled. Most often all the harmful acts, upsets, secrets and oppression will blow to view and dissipate.</p> <p>The being after the session usually experiences the Green Zone Truth Phenomena in life. It all starts going right, they begin to manifest being in the right place, at the right time. Present time begins to fit the clients wants.</p> <p>There is obviously much more than this, but you can go to the web-page:</p> <p>http://www. knowledgism.com</p> <p>And scroll down to the Presence Process section and perhaps find out for yourself.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw22.html","title":"The True Reason For The Zones Technology","text":""},{"location":"acw22.html#the-true-reason-for-the-zones-technology","title":"THE TRUE REASON FOR THE ZONES TECHNOLOGY.","text":"<p>In 1962 I began to experience a consistent phenomena.

Point A: The Processor. - Point B: The client.</p> <p>A good session is one that ends up with positive high mood level energies flowing backwards and forwards between the points A and B.</p> <p>A bad session is one that ends up with negative low mood level energies flowing backwards and forwards between the point A and B.</p> <p>This sets up a flow line between point A and point B.</p> <p>A one way flow is:</p> <p>A=== to ====&gt;B</p> <p>A two way flow is:</p> <p>A=== to ====&gt;B reverse B=== to ====&gt;A</p> <p>To cause an upgrade of the flow lines and points A and B the energy will be positive.</p> <p>To cause a downgrade of the flow lines and points A and B the energy will be negative.</p> <p>So if the Processor who is point A is positive, the client who is point B should improve in mood level.</p> <p>I personally keep things very simplistic in session. I look for:</p> <ol> <li>Is the mood level positive?</li> </ol> <p>This is fairly easy to observe the client is usually smiling or cheerful. A happy camper!</p> <ol> <li>Is the mood level negative?</li> </ol> <p>This is pretty much self evident. The client looks grim, serious, glum or sad. An unhappy camper!</p> <p>If number 2 is present, the mood level is negative. I am alerted to the possibility of potential By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>The client is also a point A too many, in his/her life. Knowing this, then the clients flows to their point B\u2019s could be influencing the indicators, or it might be between me and the client.</p> <p>This brings a further flow line into play:</p> <p>Processor= to ==&gt;Client - Client= to ==&gt;Outside session Point C.</p> <p>Most times a simple question such as: What is your attention on? will free the stuck negativity energy creating point.  The client goes to where their attention is (outside session space point C) by following the energy flow line to it. And then relays from that point C back to himself and then back to the processor: \u201cOh! I had a fight with the wife this morning, behaved rather badly,\u2019 laughs - pauses - \u201cbetter apologize.\u201d Attention frees up. The clients mood level goes positive.</p> <p>The Processor to =&gt;Client - Client to =&gt;Outside session Point C. Sets up an ever widening sphere of influence and spacation for both the processor and client. Add to it the ability of the client to move to the location in time and place of the upset and them relay the data back via themselves following this sequence:</p> <p>Outside session Point C. = to =&gt;Client - Client to =&gt;The Processor.</p> <p>This is known as the \u201citsa-maker line.\u201d THE MOST IMPORTANT ENERGY FLOW LINE IN PROCESSING.</p> <p>For if this \u201citsa-maker line.\u201d is not present then the client and processor cannot change the energy flows or point B\u2019 or point C\u2019s from NEGATIVE to POSITIVE.</p> <p>The Processor to =&gt;Client - Client to =&gt;Outside session Point C. - Outside session Point C. = to =&gt;Client - Client to =&gt;The Processor, is known as the full effective eductive communication cycle. This was first discovered and written about, as far back in time as Socrates. The eductive communication techniques have been known and applied by master teachers for over 2000 years.</p> <p>You are dealing with the pure mechanics of the interchange of energy and flows.</p> <p>The mood level of a Point A can affect the mood level of Point B.</p> <p>The mood level of Point B can affect the mood level of Point A.</p> <p>So you have 3 basic things to observe;</p> <ol> <li> <p>Mood level of Point A.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mood level of Point B.</p> </li> <li> <p>The mood level of what is traveling on the effective eductive communication cycle.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To have a winning or free flowing able to be positive or negative at will type of session, all 3 need to be able to be positive or negative at will and in full working order.</p> <p>The Processor should be alert to any one of these 3 indicators if they turn and stay negative.</p>"},{"location":"acw30.html#the-itsa-maker-line","title":"THE ITSA-MAKER LINE","text":"<p>This line is the most damaged line on most cases.</p> <p>The reasons for this are multitudinous.

So I asked him to do a very short session and tell me the moment she begins to drop in mood level. to stop the session immediately and call me back.</p> <p>He did just that.</p> <p>The drop in mood came as soon as he asked the first question.</p> <p>So I instructed him to ask: \u201cWhat happens when I ask you a question - pause - does it remind you of something?\u201d</p> <p>He did that, the clients answer: \u201c Well yes. my mother always asked me a question and as I went answer it she would say \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about it!\u201d and storm off.\u201d</p> <p>So I had the processor run:</p> <p>a.

Any other answers.</p> <p>Steps a. - b. - c. were run over and over again to very causative indicators, the full Green Zone Truth Phenomena.</p> <p>This ran for almost 25 hours. There were 1000\u2019s of questions and 10,000\u2019s of undelivered communications. The By-Passed Charge on answering questions was enormous. It instantly destroyed the effective eductive comm cycle. Once this was handled she ran like clockwork. The changes in her life for the better from that time were immense.</p> <p>To handle the By-Passed Charge we had to: 1 Search for the area. 2. Find the cause. 3. Signify or indicate it to the client. 4.  Verify what was found by correctly handling and erasing the By-Passed Charge. Now the positive energies could flow between all points. The Green Zone Truth Phenomena would begin to manifest in session and in life.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw31.html","title":"Distinction Exercise: Putting Order Into Chaos","text":"<p>ROUGH DRAFT:</p>"},{"location":"acw31.html#putting-order-into-chaos","title":"PUTTING ORDER INTO CHAOS","text":"<p>The presence of By-Passed Charge means very simply there is an area of chaos that is blocking the natural flows of energy between terminals.</p> <p>The easiest way to handle By-Passed Charge is to do the handling as part of the introduction to your subject.</p> <p>The most chaos is usually encountered when a client or student begins their first action.</p> <p>On this planet at this time there is great chaos, dispersal and unreality as to what the composite person is.</p> <p>It is this chaos, dispersal and unreality that makes public dissemination so painful for most practitioners. It also can be the source of enormous By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>I have found the best way to handle this is to set the client up ahead of time by introducing them to who and what they are and what they are not, by simple drills, exercises or processes that can be done at a low cost, take as long as is needed, series of actions.</p> <p>One of the most effective is the Distinction Exercise. This was taken from a Depak Chopra process that helped many people put their cancer in remission. My thought was if it was powerful enough to do that, it would be very easy to put order into the chaos of a beings present time existence using the same approach.</p> <p>Surprisingly it worked very well. It is a superb successful indicator and handling exercise for separating and becoming aware of areas of By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>The Instructor instant hats them on how to do it.

I\u2019m not expecting a full answer, as we leave tech here and go straight into organisation, with political and economical issues.</p> <p>I do know this, I helped build the Mission Network.</p> <p>This was group of independent practitioners. Yet as a group individually they were tough and fierce competitors, yet the top Mission Holders also worked together, and were willing to help ANY other Mission Holder. It was in fact two separate Hats.</p> <p>We had the best of all worlds, an individual game to play, and a team game to play.</p> <p>Any Universe is composed of multiple anchor points. (Terminals)  Each anchor point MUST be equal to the other in power and ability to hold a position. The smallest a Universe can become is to be down to two terminals. One Positive - One Negative. Each must be similar in size, power, strength, cleverness and abilities.</p> <p>A single pole cell (terminal) is known as a free radical, this has been found to cause cancer. (?)</p> <p>As the Mission Network grew so too did the Org Network. The bigger the Mission Network the bigger the Orgs.</p> <p>They were opposing Terminals.</p> <p>The Orgs would discharge against the Mission Network and the Mission Network would discharge against the Orgs, Each processing the other upscale.</p> <p>(You have a similar scene in session. The Processor plus the Client opposes the Clients case.)</p> <p>There were other independent Organizations. The GO was one of them.</p> <p>When the CMO began their take over of Scio, they systematically collapsed each Independent Anchor Point (Group or Org.) into \u201conly one.\u201d</p> <p>By smashing and taking over the Mission Network they were triumphant. They were the only ones standing. They won the battle, but completely lost the GAME.</p> <p>Can you imagine if in the National Football League, if the only team allowed to play are The Dallas Sea Orgs (formerly the Dallas Cowboys, but they all signed Billion year contracts, hence the name change.) The NFL and the rest would just walk away. Who\u2019s going to play or watch if there is only one team on the playing field.</p> <p>The FreeZone is Scio\u2019s only true opponent. Therefore Scio WILL match terminals with the FreeZone. Even if it has to destroy itself in the process.</p> <p>The law is simple: \u201cSo desperate is a being to have a game, he will take on ALL manner of liabilities in order to be on a parity with his opponents. If he is too powerful, able, clever, rich, etc., he will limit his power, ability, cleverness, riches to that of his opponents in order to have parity. Or he will end up with his greatest loss. The LOSS of THE GAME.\u201d</p> <p>LOSS OF GAMES and LOSS OF OPPONENTS are possibly the biggest cause of BPC there is.</p> <p>So you have in most GAMES. The game owners and the game players. The Game Owners also own teams. The Game Owners wear two hats, Team Owner. Game Owner. These are quite separate. But you cannot become a Game Owner unless you are a Team Owner.</p> <p>The Game Owners do what\u2019s best for the overall game. Omni determined. Team Owners do what is best for their team. Self determined.</p> <p>The FreeZone has few if any Team Owners, until that takes place the few Team Owners will keep in communication and help each other as best they can, while still being fierce competitors.</p> <p>Without teams there are no games. Consequently no Game Owners.</p> <p>To have Team Owners you must have people who want to own a team. So we are at the beginning, looking for those who want to have a Team.</p> <p>Those with the heaviest by-passed charge are stuck in loss of games. By-passed charge by its very nature causes separation, individuation, distance and unreality. Until that by-passed charge is fully handled there will be no real connections. Plus initially when a connection is made and a contact is initiated it will turn on more by-passed charge that needs to be handled. This cycle may take quite sometime to handle before the connectees are comfortable with each other and are free of by-passed charge.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw33.html","title":"The Demands Of By-passed Charge Handling","text":"<p>ROUGH DRAFT:</p>"},{"location":"acw33.html#the-demands-of-by-passed-charge-handling","title":"THE DEMANDS OF BY-PASSED CHARGE HANDLING","text":"<p>By-Passed Charge handling is possibly the most adroit of the people handling skills.

Do it to me\u2019ers can forget about it.</p> <p>Only those willing to take charge, willing to lose all, willing to risk all, willing to be fully responsible should attempt By-Passed Charge handling.</p> <p>Handling By-Passed Charge is the ultimate processor skill and requires the strongest basics.</p> <p>It also requires great certainty of who you are, plus the ability to adopt ANY identity that will act as an opposite to the identity the being is stuck in. The pc is in a Created As A Pre-Programmed (by the By-Passed Charge) Synthetic You (This is the current false identity that the pc believes they are, and all of their friends and acquaintances, and the culture is constantly solidly agreeing upon.)</p> <p>Free Zone handling of By-Passed Charge is very different than what an Organization handles. Organizations have all sorts of containers of By-Passed Charge in place and solidly agreed upon.</p> <p>Most Organizations composite mood levels cannot encompass or span the spectrums of the scales needed to fully handle most areas of By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>Where-as the FreeZone is almost boundary-less. This means the coming explosion as the being who has been encased in By-Passed Charge for eons, and has been dramatizing some humanoid devoid of spirit identity, which places the being below the Red Zone or absent, can be very loud and violent as the being travels back up the scales. Often roaring up the Zones and scales like a freight train.</p> <p>The Processor must be able to skip upwards through several hundred instant created gradient identities. (Each, slightly bigger than the pc\u2019s.)</p> <p>The By-Passed Charge Processor is always slightly bigger than the pc, until the pc is able to be themselves. This is the point the itsa-maker line begins to go in and the pc is greater than their case.</p> <p>A lot of people do this sequence:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Search.</p> </li> <li> <p>Find.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signify.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verify.</p> </li> </ol> <p>As a matter of natural action. Any master of a game or skill naturally observes their area of expertise and will put that which is out of order back into its proper place until their ideals are attained.</p> <p>Step 1. Is SEARCH.</p> <p>Search for what? The correctness of who, what, when, where, why, how, intention, mood level, etc.</p> <p>For a processor the first observation is based upon: What do we have here?</p> <p>Is the who PRESENT? (Spiritual Being)</p> <p>If yes, great!</p> <p>If not: Then what is here?</p> <p>Usually it is a fixed identity.</p> <p>We will use as an example: A hater identity. (A being who thinks, believes and has been convinced that this is HIM.)</p> <p>How do you know this? He can\u2019t be the identity or not be the identity at will.</p> <p>It looks something like this:</p> <p>In the Red Zone, one of the ATTRIBUTES is \u201cworks against.\u201d So the flow coming at you tells you instantly where to look. The pc has usually been</p> <p>in this identity for so long they have no idea that there is a difference. All their operating machinery, communication devices are set</p> <p>on \u201coppose mode.\u201d</p> <p>An aware Spiritual Being has power of choice over what mode they want.</p> <p>They can easily and comfortably \u201cwork against\u201d Red Zone, \u201cwork for\u201d Yellow Zone or \u201cwork with\u201d Green Zone at will.</p> <p>For a session to work you need YOU and the PC to \u201cwork with,\u201d able to hold a position while YOU guide the PC to inspect what it is wanted or not wanted.</p> <p>A PC trapped in By-Passed Charge cannot inspect or separate themselves from the \u201cunwanted condition or identity.\u201d</p> <p>They are being \u201ca HIM that is not HIM.\u201d Kind of a big lie!</p> <p>The FIND step: PC appears to hate everyone and everything.</p> <p>A truly good By-Passed Charge processor will usually need to SIGNIFY only one indication.</p> <p>i.e.. HATEFUL aren\u2019t we! It can be tossed off as a sneering \u201cmake nothing of\u201d comment. As that is the only type of communication a Red Zoner can receive. The PC will instantly begin to make more of themselves, as they</p> <p>are \u201cworking against\u201d the processor. But to do that, they to a degree have to separate from what they are being.</p> <p>If it is the correct indication, the VERIFICATION will be the PC able to</p> <p>communicate about that. Usually the PC will quickly go upscale, traveling the different Zones gradients swiftly.</p> <p>The Processor goes upscale with them shifting from \u201cmake nothing\u201d to \u201cmake less\u201d to \u201cmake more of\u201d the PC and less of the condition.</p> <p>What you as a processor want to create is MOTION from the PC, then MOTION to and from the case. Mainly undelivered communications, protests, unexpressed resentments, evil intentions, etc.</p> <p>A PC who is buried under By-Passed Charge is IMPLODED into being created and contained as a DOT.</p> <p>A PC who suddenly lets loose an EXPLOSION of force, mass, and charge is in actuality de-DOT-ing itself, It is re-emerging as a PRESENCE. The force, mass, violence and charge that appears to be getting thrown in your direction is the PC emerging and taking charge of their own universe.</p> <p>As the PC expresses these, they begin to separate from them.</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;YOU...&gt;&gt;&gt;.........&gt;&lt;.............&lt;&lt;&lt;A Hater&lt;&lt;\nO O O O O O O.........&gt;&lt;.............X pc X X evil X\nO.....................O.........&gt;&lt;.............X X charge X X\nO.....................O.........&gt;&lt;.............X X hate X pcX\nO...Processor...O&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Versus&lt;&lt;&lt;X X&gt;mass&lt; X X\nO.....................O.........&gt;&lt;.............Xpc X X hate X\nO.....................O.........&gt;&lt;.............X X charge X X\nO O O O O O O.........&gt;&lt;.............X evil X X pc X\n</code></pre> <p>Order is being put into chaos.

Dissemination and Sales.</p> <p>What messes these subjects up are the attempt to impose your own or the group wants onto the public. This acts as a wrong indication and creates</p> <p>By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>By-Passed Charge handling demands that you Search, Find, Signify, and Verify what is in front of you.</p> <p>Wanting to take over the world is not very real to most public individuals.

Yet that is often where the most difficult to handle BY-PASSED CHARGE abounds.</p> <p>To fund my writing and research I would often engage in Leadership, Executive, Corporate Coaching and Consulting. Many were multi-billion dollar international Fortune 500 Companies.</p> <p>These international Fortune 500 Companies were very much result orientated. As I charged between $1000 to $1500 for 10 hours of training per student, minimum 20 students - maximum 30 students in a class room format, the pressure to produce was intense, as I also had a money back if not satisfied guarantee.</p> <p>It truly hurts to refund, especially if it is about $30,000 to $40,000. </p> <p>Almost always the area I would be training would be the worst performing part of the Corporation, containing huge quantities of BY-PASSED CHARGE and abusive \u201ctrying to make it work solutions,\u201d these students and clients were not instructor or leadership friendly. Too say the least their evil intentions towards management was very close to the surface. I of course, was in their eyes part of management = THE ENEMY!</p> <p>To establish myself as a terminal they could trust required that I Search, Find, Signify, and Verify the correct BY-PASSED CHARGE. I had roughly 5 to 6 minutes to do this from the time I began communicating about my subject to the workshop.</p> <p>The first thing I would do is give each participant a 100 questions to write yes - no - maybe - alongside of. These questionnaires would then be gathered up and immediately tallied and graphed on a Life Analysis Profile. </p> <p>The life Analysis Profile is broken up into three areas, RED - YELLOW - GREEN ZONES and seven columns.</p> <p>The marked graphs would be given back to each participant. This set the stage for me to be listened too by them.</p> <p>I would then educate them on what each Zone would mean and how being in that Zone would affect their future. At work, home, sports, relationships, etc. This was done using them to give examples of GREEN ZONE behavior, etc.</p> <p>As a participant would originate a particular Zone incident, it would indicate on others and they in turn would relate their similars. As their confidence in me grew, their willingness to bring up Red Zone areas would begin to show up. Before long we would be sharing our biggest lifetime disasters and upsets.</p> <p>What had occurred was the Zones data acted as a correction list, and separated the being or identity from the condition they were in, and allowed further observation of the good from the bad, the up from the down, the right from the wrong, the truth from the lies.</p> <p>From my point of view I now had a group who KNEW where UP was, and could now be indicated too and directed towards that area of UP. More importantly I had rehabilitated their itsa-maker lines.</p> <p>When a being is submerged in By-Passed Charge they have NO UP, NO DOWN, NO TIME SENSE, NO WHEN, NO WHERE, NO HOW, NO WHAT, no or very little ability to distinguish what is them and what is not. Itsa-maker lines cannot go in under those circumstances. No itsa-maker line means there are no effective eductive communication cycles.</p> <p>Without an effective eductive communication cycle, no being, let alone a group of beings can process themselves upscale.</p> <p>The effective eductive communication cycle is in actuality the basic energy re-cycling machine of a being.</p> <p>Further when the effective eductive communication cycle can be directed at specific areas or subjects it will unlock trapped energy and return or restore life back to the area or subject.</p> <p>By using a languaging that almost everyone is familiar with, such as; the who, what, where, when, how, why, intention and mood level, you do not need to spend hours clearing words, which is almost impossible to do over BY-PASSED CHARGE anyway. Add to it, a color combination they are totally familiar with and you have a powerful Search, Find, Signify, and Verify the correct BY-PASSED CHARGE, locate and indicate tool.</p> <p>Beings when they are submerged in BY-PASSED CHARGE tend to throw the baby out with the bath water. That is they invalidate all their strengths, skills and abilities as well as they tend to fixate on their weaknesses.</p> <p>To submerge a Spiritual Being requires vast quantities of abusive wrongnesses, wrong answers, wrong items, wrong who\u2019s, what\u2019s, where\u2019s, when\u2019s, how\u2019s, why\u2019s, intention\u2019s and mood levels, plus the Spiritual Being must be convinced that they are BAD. The easiest and best way to unsubmerge a being is to educate them on how to handle BY-PASSED CHARGE.</p> <p>The Zones Technology does just that. By being able to distinguish exactly what Zone each area or activity of your life or the people you are connected with are in, can lead to a much easier life, better more realistic people handling and correct estimation of predictable outcomes on most endeavors.</p> <p>The act of indicating what area or subject is Red or Yellow Zone immediately separates the being or identity from the condition they were in, and allows further observation, which in turn opens up the willingness to do something that will change the area or subject for the better.</p> <p>You will be amazed at how your environment will change for the better if all those in it are hatted on the Green - Yellow - and Red Zone. Just the definitions.</p> <p>Should you also make sure that everyone you are connected to has a workable effective eductive communication cycle then the area, subject or people will naturally process the area, subject or people upscale. Providing they are aware of what UP is.</p> <p>The truth about the life most of us lead is; for every Green Zone area or subject we have, there are 1,000\u2019s of Yellow Zone areas or subjects and 10,000\u2019s of Red Zone areas or subjects. There are no perfect people.</p> <p>All education, learning, experiencing, mastering, acts of self improvement, etc. require the presence of a workable effective eductive communication cycle.</p> <p>To knowingly be able to train and/or rehabilitate a workable effective eductive communication cycle in others is possibly the singlemost valuable skill any being can have.</p>"},{"location":"acw35.html#the-green-zone","title":"THE GREEN ZONE","text":"<p>The Green Zone is an operating level in which the individual is demonstrating a high level of skill, competence, and success.

I noticed he didn\u2019t look to good, his eyes were surrounded by dark circles, and when I spoke, he seemed to wince.</p> <p>I asked him: \u201cAre you all right?</p> <p>He answered: \u201cWell I\u2019ve got this splitting headache.\u201d</p> <p>I asked: \u201cWhen did it start?\u201d</p> <p>He answered: \u201cLast night about an hour after Mary-Sue and I finished session.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?  I again questioned.</p> <p>\u201cWell I suppose it could have something to do with the session.\u201d He replied.</p> <p>I had noticed a meter was on his desk, so I indicated to him would he mind picking up the cans, he smiled and reach for the cans and handed the meter over to me.</p> <p>I said.  \u201cStart of Session.\u201d Quietly.</p> <p>\u201cNow tell me what happened?\u201d The meter tone arm was at 4.7 and the needle was stuck solid.</p> <p>He told me he and Mary-Sue were doing some Goals-Problems-Mass running and they had found a new truncated pair of items.  The meter tone arm was still stuck at 4.7 and the needle was still stuck solid.</p> <p>I asked, \u201cWas there something not quite correct about the items?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWeeeeell\u201d in that long drawl voice of his, \u201cIt kinda invalidates the other set of items that we had found earlier.\u201d - long pause - \u201calso it puts two different GPM goals into present time.\u201d The meter tone arm was still stuck at 4.7 and the needle was still stuck solid.</p> <p>I was beginning to feel out of my depth, \u201cwhat do I do now?\u201d Terror was beginning to gnaw at my stomach.  \u201cJeeeesus!\u201d Why did I do this?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly he looks at me.  \u201cInwardly stark terror turns on!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m losing it big time.\u201d I think.</p> <p>He asks \u201cwhat\u2019s the meter doing?\u201d I tell him.  \u201cHmm!\u201d then silence.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not going right!\u201d I worry.</p> <p>So I mumble: \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve hit into a glum area?\u201d Recalling high tone arm often means an area of problems surrounded by service facs.</p> <p>\u201cHuh!\u201d he said contemptuously.  Definitely withholding a snarl.</p> <p>I sink lower into my funk.  I\u2019m now totally at effect.  In complete overwhelm.</p> <p>\u201cWeell - what do you know!  - there is a whole package of service facs here, they are - he lists out several - he quickly runs them - the tone arm begins to blow down - the needle swings free - he starts to brighten up.</p> <p>He then begins to re-align several of his previous items and GPM goals.</p> <p>Talk about operating in uncharted, unmapped territory.  I didn\u2019t know half of what he was covering.  I just wanted out of there. Suddenly the room went almost completely dark.  I thought a cloud had gone across the sun.  I reached over to turn on the lamp on the desk, only it was on.</p> <p>The blackness was being generate by him.  He started laughing. \u201cWow!  I sure got this area in a mess.  This set belong here and this set belong with this goal, this serv fac belongs to this GPM.  These items are not my items!\u201d</p> <p>He ran chains of harmful acts in seconds.</p> <p>The blackness just dissolved.</p> <p>I asked: \u201cHow is your headache?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d \u201cOkay if we end here?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Sure.\u201d I answered.  (THANK GOD!!!)</p> <p>The session lasted about 45 minutes, though to me it seemed like an eternity.  To me this session was a total disaster.  This was before the days of locate and indicate.  I had evaluated, put the clients attention on the meter.  Gone totally weak valence.  Turned session control over to the client.  Let the client end session on his own determinism.  Gone into uncharted, unmapped territory.</p> <p>He asked me to come back the same time tomorrow as he had a 3.45 appointment.</p> <p>I agreed, of course.</p> <p>That night he gave a lecture.  Just before he started the lecture, he looked at me, tapped his head, smiled and made a circle with his finger and thumb, indicating he was okay.</p> <p>For me I was in a complete funk.  I was completely accessed.</p> <p>What had happened?</p> <p>I had run into more knowledge, velocity of force and charge than I was willing to handle or for that matter capable of handling.</p> <p>The client was able to run his case far better and deeper than I could process.</p> <p>Now I had to meet him again.</p>"},{"location":"acw36.html#the-next-meeting","title":"THE NEXT MEETING","text":"<p>Again he greeted me warmly.  This time he went straight to business.  He wanted me to graduate.</p> <p>I said, \u201cI\u2019d love to but I hadn\u2019t gotten what I came for.  The ability and certainty to process anyone, at anytime, on anything.\u201d</p> <p>He was somewhat taken aback by this.  We talked some more.  He asked how the research we were doing on the Heletrobus Implants.</p> <p>I answered: \u201cThere are quite a number of off-beat implants in that area that are interfering with handling the area.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d he asked.  I told him.</p> <p>He nodded okay.  Then reached for the meter and cans, handing me the cans.</p> <p>He gently said: \u201cStart of Session.\u201d</p> <p>It was then I was hit with the most amazing, vast, powerful, effective communication cycle I had ever experienced.</p> <p>It contained the three attributes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Dynamic presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Caring.</p> </li> <li> <p>Friendliness.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The four intentions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The willingness to have the client win big.

I could see my tone arm, it started at 2.8, as soon as that communication cycle hit me, the tone arm started soaring.  It shot up to 6.5 and the needle stuck solid.</p> <p>He gently asked: \u201cWhat did you just look at?\u201d</p> <p>I hummed and oohed around, to be honest I didn\u2019t really know.  I mumbled \u201cits some huge mass.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it?\u201d</p> <p>So I described it.  Big, black, highly charged.</p> <p>\u201cAny idea what it contains?\u201d</p> <p>I started laughing.  \u201cYeah!  All the unconfronted masses and charge from the processing I\u2019ve had over the years.\u201d The mass just started to disintegrate.  My tone arm blew down to the 3.0 range and the needle went free..</p> <p>I itsa-ed: \u201cThe problem I ran into was the processors couldn\u2019t confront the force, charge and masses.\u201d</p> <p>It was years later I realized that his communication cycle allowed the full force, charge and masses to come to view and run out.</p> <p>He ended the session.  We chatted some more.

The level of force and charge I was willing to handle left much to be improved upon.</p> <p>What was more embarrassing was the fact, at that time I was one of the highest trained processors in the world, plus all my co-processing was with the best of the best.  If I had not have received such a demonstration of mastery and competence, I would still be in a state of \u201cI didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d That meeting set a whole new level of excellence and mastery of what was needed to have a masterful communication cycle.</p> <p>The was a vast difference between his communication cycle and mine.  Mine was like a little squiggly line and his was an 80 lane highway that could comfortably take any force or charge along it. More than that his intention was to know all.</p> <p>But what impressed me the most was his intention for me to win big.</p> <p>It is the communication cycle that is the basic reason that causes processing to work.  If the communication cycle is faulty or weak, the charge and force cannot be dissipated.  What makes this so difficult to observe or correct is that it is a telepathically projected 3 dimensional holographic spiritual manifestation.</p> <p>With a masterful communication cycle in place, processes magically work.  If it is faulty too much force, charge and mass will be by-passed.  If this faulty communication cycle goes on too long the client will build up too much by-passed and unhandled force, charge and mass and will be difficult to get in session or will quit getting processed altogether.</p> <p>The resultant by-passed and unhandled force, charge and mass will compress the beings ability to create and control space, and time into a tiny area sometimes as small as a dot, thus effectively inhibiting its ability to Be - Do - or Have in present time.  This compression phenomena is not tangible, it usually manifests in having little or no time, no space, no reach, no wins in life and living.</p> <p>The best way to remedy this condition is to rehabilitate the beings communication cycle.

It is only when those steps are violated do you have problems with by-passed charge.</p> <p>The presence of by passed charge means several steps have been violated.</p> <p>A rough session can cause some by-passed charge, but if the clients basics are in, they will correct any outnesses and continue to make gain.</p> <p>When heavy by-passed charge is present, too many steps have been violated.</p> <p>As processing and training are the primary vehicle you are using to clear and ascend your client, they must be clear and capable of ascension.</p> <p>The first basic that needs to be recognized is that processing and training occur on an artificial time track. It is a finite time track, though it appears to parallel the Physical Universe time track, it is in fact an add on slightly outside the physical universe. By finite, it spans a specific beginning, middle and end. As such it is the doorway to other dimensions. These other dimensions whether they be the mind, the body, the other universes or the environment, can only intrude if a line of some kind is connected. If the line is involuntarily or unknowingly connected to an area of charge, then it is somewhat difficult to find the by-passed charge.</p> <p>A BY-PASSED CHARGE handler must be very aware of lines of connection as that is from where the charge can travel along that interferes with the session.</p> <p>There are four points to be aware of - 1. The session by-passed charge. - 2. The session activator. - 3. The line the charge is traveling on. - 4. The source area of charge.</p> <p>The basic simplicity of by-passed charge spotting and handling is that somewhere during the clients first contact of this subject, their processing or training track SOMETHING was contacted and activated and A LINE was left open to an area of CHARGE. If this was not picked up immediately then the CHARGE gets by-passed.</p> <p>The most vulnerable time this can occur is when the client first makes contact with the subject. Such as reading a book, or attending an intro. course lecture. As the client opens up their universe to look, they often collide with what they cannot confront, this gets instantly suppressed, now the client tends to run as a resistive case.</p> <p>If these beginning activators or access points are overlooked the client will begin to add mass to their case due to processing and training over the top of this hidden charge source point.</p> <p>The law of by-passed charge handling is: </p>"},{"location":"acw38.html#always-go-back-to-the-point-when-the-client-was-doing-well","title":"ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE POINT \u201cWHEN\u201d THE CLIENT WAS DOING WELL.","text":"<p>Go a little earlier, (it can be an hour, day, week or two,) find what they were doing that caused them to feel good, then scan forward.

Such as reading a book, or attending an intro. course lecture.</p> <p>Why do you assume that a person never looked before he came into contact with Scientology?</p> <p>This is insulting and beneath contempt.</p> <p>No, dear Homer, your inability to note that each subject has a separate time track, that once you group the time tracks you will have trouble and BPC.</p> <p>For instance lets say the poor bastard was the son of a psychiatrist. That there were books on the subject. This is very similar to other therapies. If in a Scio. session the earlier BPC is triggered and not handled now the Scio tech is aaa with the earlier BPC. Too many sessions without separating the difference and ALL the BPC has now transferred into the Scio sessions. The hatred for the earlier practitioner is now hatred for the later practitioners.</p> <p>Now the pc cannot get case gain.</p> <p>You will find the psychiatrist son has had his itsa-maker line chopped by the father, this gets accidentally chopped by the practitioner. The BPC transfers.</p> <p>End of f/n\u2019s, end of VGI\u2019s, end of high tone comm. because there is no upper level terminal to discharge against.</p> <p>To get case gain you must have differences. Positives and Negatives. If it is all the same then there is nothing or no position from which to separate from. Consequently no elimination of BPC.</p> <p>The fact that looking and case gain occurred in other practices enhances the chances that this present time practice will be up-graded.</p> <p>The more charge on a subject, the lower down the tone scale goes the being. As you discharge what is creating the charge and by-passed charge, you cycle up the tone scale.</p> <p>On a correctly run item or area, you activate and run out every emotion from top to bottom on your way to complete erasure of the charge. That\u2019s what VGI\u2019s, Cognition, Regained Abilities are all about, you have cycled through the full spectrum of the scales, removing the charge as you progress upward. You cannot be re-activated on a well run full erasure subject.</p> <p>Subjects are separate from subjects. Scio is a late on the chain subject, thus it is easy to run to full erasure. You may have been a Budhist, a Gnostic, a Seeker of Truth, or whatever, but these each have their own WANTS, and thus their own time tracks. They also have out-lists, out-tech., out-Organisations, out-Ethics, etc. And they respond perfectly if kept on their own specific time tracks, but if you collapse them into whatever practice you are doing now you will screw up the case big time.</p> <p>This is also the reason why a practitioner needs to take each area of their present time practice areas to full F/N, VGI\u2019s, and MASTERY. Any degrade from that will destroy the ability of that practice to act as a point of order to discharge against. As the practice degrades so does the ability to attain the higher states. As the practice can only bring the client up to its level. Its the law of matching terminals or comparable magnitudes.</p> <p>Done correctly each session can run out earlier sessions by being more exact and truthful than the previous sessions. That\u2019s just plain common sense.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure if I came to work for you as a computer \u201cexpert\u201d you would very quickly begin to correct me upscale or get rid of me if I did not meet your criteria for the work that needs to be done.

But it has a long history of development.</p> <p>As long as there has been processing, there has been By-Passed Charge stirred up or caused by the processing.</p> <p>Prior to May 1963 there was very little published data about by-passed charge. Yet most of the great old time processors knew how to handle it.</p> <p>Processors such as Jack Horner, Ray and Pam Kemp, Peter Green, Louis Jordan, Wing and Smokey Angel, Elizabeth and Peter Williams, Bob Thomas, Leon Steinberg, Stanley Richards, Dennis Stephens, Dick and Jan Halpern, David and Merril Mayo, Yvonne Gilham, Jane Kember, Ava and Charles Berner, Irene and Tony Dunleavy.</p> <p>Each of these processors were masters of processing the client in front of them. They knew their Axioms down cold.</p> <p>The simple fact is each of these master processors knew and owned these two datums:</p> <p>\u201cIn the presence of truth, charge and mass dissipates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the presence of lies charge builds up, slowly compacting until it becomes a mass.\u201d</p> <p>To process a client 200 or 300 hours on a process required that the truth be constantly found, otherwise the process would build up charge and mass that would overwhelm the client, burying them in by-passed charge and mass. This is what happens when you run a false life program. The charge and mass builds up and forces you out of position.</p> <p>You must realize this style of processing was long before Ethics, Correction lists, Good and Bad Indicators, and F/N\u2019s.</p> <p>The indicator that ALL these old timers used was the Tone Scale. The basic target for their clients was to raise their tone level. This spanned the years from 1950 to 1965.</p> <p>The introduction of the Ethics as a way to handle cases with heavy By-Passed Charge, was a gross violation of the use of indicators and truth. The tone scale as an indicator was abandoned. Only the squirrels and SP\u2019s use this Tech. now!</p> <p>Information in those days was mainly word of mouth. We shared what worked, we collaborated amongst each other to pass any tech breakthroughs or successful actions. (It was a pre-labelling era.) Ron was usually informed of any successful actions. He would almost always acknowledge the source of the contributions. These acknowledgments have been omitted from the bulletins over the years.</p> <p>The development of the By-Passed Charge Handling was a huge breakthrough, it had its heydays in 1965-66. Ethics hits gradually made it very dangerous to practice. A few bold people would use it anyway, but they were too noticeable and became Ethics bait.</p> <p>The masters of By-Passed Charge Handling became the leaders of Scio. Each, in time became targets and were removed , destroyed or nullified.</p> <p>Masterful By-Passed Charge handling requires that the masterful By-Passed Charge handler violate the processors Code.</p> <p>The sequence of By-Passed Charge Handling is:</p> <p>Observe \u2014 Notice the non-optimum condition or indicators \u2014 Name it - Search \u2014 Find the area of charge \u2014 Signify it to the client \u2014 Verify that it is the correct signified indication by observing the upscaling of indicators.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must be willing to evaluate to the client what they observed.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must be willing to invalidate what the client believes to be true.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must be willing to admit immediately to the client what they observed is incorrect if the clients indicators decline.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must have no hidden agendas towards the client.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must not engage in enforcing their realities on the client.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler and the client must realize that it is a search and seek action, and that only finding the correct item or indication will alleviate the By-Passed Charge and mass. This may be 1 or 2 indications or it maybe 1000\u2019s before the correct item or indication is found.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must be willing to process through the noise, misdirectors and make guilties of the client, for when the correct item or indication is found, these angry, enraged client distractions magically disappear.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must be able to maintain a much greater position outside of the clients psychic box. In other words maintain the bigger concept.</p> <p>The masterful By-Passed Charge handler must be able to switch back to being a processor when the client begins to cognite on the By-Passed Charge, it is usually best to just let the client undo the By-Passed Charge themselves. Then check if anything else is left unflat. A few successful actions and allowing the client to finish of spotting the rest of the By-Passed Charge can give the client an enormous boost over being at cause of their case.</p> <p>You must understand this, By-Passed Charge Handling Tech has been made to be very dangerous for processors. There is a lot of By-Passed Charge and invalidation on the subject. For this Tech does not do well in a dangerous environment. It takes a safe environment to gain the confidence of processors to originate correct items and indications of charge.</p> <p>Yet this is the Tech that will recover your dreams, goals, visions and plans for the future. Too much By-Passed Charge and the charge begins to compact and become mass, which collapses your universe, the collapsed universe crushes you operating space, thus you are forced out of position, this inhibits your ability to flow power to your 3 dimensional holographic dreams, goals and visions and they get starved of space, time, energy and resources.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw44.html","title":"Locate And Indicate History","text":"<p>The history of LOCATE and INDICATE technology (Part 2)</p> <p>The March 1963 period was drawing to a close, many of the long time Briefing Course student/researchers were graduating. New students were taking their place. I had finished all the theory and practical parts so I was free to help out after my co-processing.</p> <p>The new students were not old grizzled veterans like the initial Briefing Course students, consequently they ended up in terrible case conditions sometime.</p> <p>I volunteered to \u201cfix\u201d them.</p> <p>Every afternoon there would be 3 or 4 unconscious or semiconscious pcs waiting to be fixed. Most were incapable of talking. Many would be lain prone on the floor. I would stick the cans in their hands, force there fingers around the cans and proceed to handle them.</p> <p>To be in that state of immense pain and by-passed charge meant that the body was so full of case charge that the Spirit was pushed out. Somewhere up on the ceiling or buried inside the charge.</p> <p>In other words there was no available being to communicate to!</p> <p>What I had to do was impinge with enough force on the mental mass that was burying the pc hard enough to lift it off or move it away from him, so that he could assist and regain control over his mental masses, force and charge.</p> <p>If you can imagine someone trapped inside a collapsed building with all sorts of debris piled on top of him or preventing him from reaching safety, that is what happens when a being has massive by-passed charge.</p> <p>Law 1. You do not process the being.</p> <p>Law 2.  You directly process the charged area, by impingement aimed directly at the bank/case/mass/lies/wrongness/whatever.</p> <p>It is done by directly impinging on the exact area or item. This will move the bank/case/mass/lies/ wrongness/whatever away from the being, which allows the being the space and ability to take a causative position from where they can differentiate what is or what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>At which point the pcs itsa-maker line goes in. Now you can relay by questions to the being and they can then send a line to the area to find the rest of the story. This restores YOU plus the PC handling their bank/case/mass/lies/ wrongness/whatever.</p> <p>But, you must begin in this manner.</p> <p>You DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS. You just fire statements. The shorter the better. The statements would cover what could go wrong on the level the pc was processing on, this was done rapid fire with a slight pause between each statement. Alertly watching the meter as you called of the items..</p> <p>i.e.</p> <p>Wrong goal.</p> <p>Wrong item.</p> <p>Missed goal.</p> <p>Missed item.</p> <p>Jumped into another GPM.</p> <p>A mass.</p> <p>A missed mass.</p> <p>An incident.</p> <p>A by-passed incident.</p> <p>Wrong listing question.</p> <p>As you called the item, you indicated what read and indicated \u201ccharge has been by-passed on that!\u201d</p> <p>This is possibly the most exciting processing there is, as the correct indication would bring the pc right back to life. One second they are lying comatose on the ground, the next second their eyes shoot open, they stir, they sit up, they get onto the chair, their itsa-maker line goes in and they begin to uncollapse their universe.</p> <p>The above is roughly the original duplicate of the first by-passed charge correction list.</p> <p>Anyway I did this for a few weeks before Ron found out what I was doing. He immediately grasped the importance of this method of handling by-passed charge.</p> <p>But I am sorry to say few have really grasped the mechanics of this style of processing.</p> <p>The biggest mistake most poorly trained processors make is to believe the By-Passed Charge is from some session mistake. This is far from the truth. The By-Passed Charge that is causing the pc to be Affinity-Reality-Communication Broken with the processor could be stemming from the UNKNOWNS from a Goals-Problems-Mass or upper universe.</p> <p>The pc being uneducated plus in to much pain or hurt is unable to look in the correct area, therefore turns on the nearest live terminal in its vicinity usually the processor and blames and attacks that and the processing as the cause of the upset. So it is vital the processor and the pc get hatted on the area of handling By-Passed Charge in as many levels as possible.</p> <p>But the basic in handling By-Passed Charge and ARC X\u2019s is:</p> <p>Law 1. You do not process the being.</p> <p>Law 2.  You directly process the charged area, by impingement aimed directly at the bank/case/mass/lies/ wrongness/whatever.</p> <p>The basic fact is, underlying ALL by-passed charge or ARCX\u2019s is an area that is UNKNOWN to the pc.</p> <p>The longer the pc is ARC broken the more UNKNOWN is the by-passed charged causing area or bank/case/mass/lies/ wrongness/whatever that is creating the state of ARC breakingness.</p> <p>The secret to handling By-Passed Charge and ARCX\u2019s is to find the correct area of By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>A session Affinity-Reality-Communication Break is very different from a Goals-Problems-Mass caused Affinity-Reality-Communication Break. So to is an upper universe By-Passed Charge and Affinity-Reality-Communication Break. These cannot be handled by the wrong By-Passed Charge Assessments and wrong correction lists.</p> <p>You must also realize By-Passed Charge and Affinity-Reality-Communication Break handling was developed long before there was a problem with mind altering drugs and psychedelics. These throw the being up into other more powerfully charged universes, that have not been fully identified as yet, thus the level of UNKNOWN and FORCE is tremendous.</p> <p>When you enter into the unmapped, uncharted areas you need to really have superb processing skills and know how to create an on the spot By-Passed Charge or Affinity-Reality-Communication Break correction list, because it will be unique only to you.</p> <p>I have been processing and handling cases for 34 years since this beginning period of By-Passed Charge and Affinity-Reality-Communication Breaks handling and have isolated some 82 separate forms of By-Passed Charge and Affinity-Reality-Communication Break causing objects or creations. None of these are known to Scio. They are what have contributed to causing the demise of Scio Technology. (Most of these 82 objects or creations if identified can be run by the Shock, Mass handling techniques.)</p> <p>It does not take much of an observation to realize that almost ALL of the class XII\u2019s, X\u2019s VIII\u2019s, VII\u2019s and VI\u2019s have left Scio or are no longer processing. They almost all left Affinity-Reality-Communication broken with Scio.  They are ARC broken. Charge has been by-passed on them.</p> <p>Many are in sad effect, most are opposed to their own dreams and are no longer playing the game they want to play. That\u2019s what By-Passed Charge does to a being.</p> <p>Many of these UNKNOWN causes of By-Passed Charge cannot be handled by one processor, it takes a team of processors working with the pc to hold the object or creation still enough so that the processor and the pc can permeate the mass, force and charge. There are third dynamic \u201cgang\u201d areas of By-Passed Charge and ARC break causing objects or creations that have to be run simultaneously by many, before the By-Passed Charge and ARCX\u2019s can be fully handled. It is this area of By-Passed Charge and ARCX\u2019s that many of the drug cases have collided with. Failure to recognize exactly what has been by-passed will cause the being to mis-own these third dynamic areas of By-Passed Charge.</p> <p>Many of these By-Passed Charge causing objects or creations were discovered from the need to handle the By-Passed Charge and massive ARCX\u2019s caused or triggered by Ascension Experiences.</p> <p>No one will make it out until they have handled EVERY piece of By-Passed Charge on their case.</p> <p>To be OT or Godlike require a playing field with fellow players who are willing to let the OT or God powers be part of the game. To be OT or Godlike is very difficult to do if your restoration of powers and abilities causes every one around you to get over-restimulated, and throws them into their areas of By-Passed Charge and ARC breaks them.

It is where the psychotics, the religious maniacs, the galactic criminals, the galactic malcontents, the habitual alcohol and drug users, the severely dysfunctionals, the politically incorrects, and the uncontrollable geniuses were dumped. </p> <p>If there was ever a hell planet, this is it.  You have only to read the newspaper or watch the evening news to recognize the lunacy and savagery of several areas of the population on this planet.</p> <p>At the same time, there are wide, powerful groups of geniuses who are tremendously brave and persistent that have guided and helped put order and civilization into this chaos pit.</p> <p>Nothing is as it seems on planet Earth because almost all its inhabitants are locked in psychic jails or asylums that are modifying their behaviour patterns.  That is why it is so hard to find trustworthy people.</p> <p>The most amazing and incredible part of this psychic conditioning is that it transcends all time, space, objects, and energy barriers.</p> <p>The behaviour modification conditioning may have been put in place trillions of years ago.</p> <p>The technique is the use of telepathically projected imagery combined with quantities of life-force particles that have the power to override you and your quantities of life-force particles.</p> <p>For example:  You were once a great leader and you hated incompetence.  You realized that the people you led were incompetent and you felt you were surrounded by enemies.  To handle these problems you issued an edict that incompetence was illegal and that it was punishable by death or incarceration, plus massive tax increases.  You backed this projected image with 1,000,000 life-force particles.</p> <p>This enraged the millions of people you led.  They rioted and broke into your palace. Grabbing you, they tore your body to shreds.</p> <p>While they were destroying your body they were also telepathically projecting:  \u201cYou must never lead again.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re less than even the lowest of the population.\u201d  \u201cYou are the king of incompetence,\u201d and  \u201cYou are sentenced to an eternity of being incompetent.\u201d  These images were reinforced by a million life-force particles from each member of the population.  A total of one hundred billion life-force particles to your one million.  You are under complete domination by these beings.   YOU WILL BE INCOMPETENT.</p> <p>Whenever you demonstrate competence, you suddenly feel you\u2019re being torn to pieces. You manifest tremendous anxiety attacks. You feel tired all the time. You make stupid mistakes. You crash and burn.  You decide,  \u201cThat must never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>In your next life, you find you cannot learn anything.  Reading and writing is impossible.  Any attempt to learn something throws you into terrible anxiety attacks followed by deep depression.</p> <p>You know that your future contains only minuscule games, or worse, no games, unless you handle this psychic jail.</p> <p>Another example:  You were a great and well-respected writer and playwright.  You wrote a series of plays over a period of time.  The problem was, these plays violated the religious belief systems of the day.</p> <p>You were ordered to the Temple to meet the Council of Elders.  You were informed that you must remove certain portions of your text or face excommunication and exile.</p> <p>You became enraged and you projected destructive images at the council, backed by ten million life-force particles.  They in turn projected destructive images back at you:  \u201cYou can never write again.\u201d  \u201cYou must never be in a powerful position.\u201d  \u201cYou will die.\u201d  These are backed with a cumulative total of one hundred million life-force particles, or ten to your one. </p> <p>You had a massive heart attack and died as you left the Temple.</p> <p>From that time on, you experienced a complete mental block and powerful and painful psychosomatic sensations throughout your body whenever you picked up a pen.  You put down the pen and the pain and mental blocks disappeared.</p> <p>You always dream of being a writer but you never write.  You have a constant feeling of failure and a sense of loss of integrity and self respect.</p> <p>Your life, your dreams, and your paradigms are out of your control.  You are not at cause over your position, your location, your career, your relationships, or what you really want.</p> <p>The simple fact is that telepathically projected images backed by large quantities of other\u2019s life-force particles are monitoring your behaviour.</p> <p>It is this telepathically projected image and life-force particle package that traps families and opponents into a never-ending repetition of involuntarily replicated, destructive games and roles.</p> <p>To end these destructive games and roles it is necessary to undo and take responsibility for what you and your opponents created, take back your projected images and life-force particles, and send back your opponents\u2019 images and return their life-force particles.  When this is done the situation will vanish miraculously.</p> <p>It is this telepathic ability backed by quantities of life-force particles that lies behind all unwanted life-problems, situations, and non-optimum conditions.</p> <p>The reason people are trapped in places, games, bad jobs, and destructive careers all can be traced to telepathically projected images backed with others\u2019 life-force particles.</p> <p>We experience this in clients who cannot reach out and arrive in Nocona. The reason I chose this location was the predominance of freedom and the absence of telepathically projected images.</p> <p>Many students and clients experience heavy withdrawal symptoms when they first arrive.  This is great for us because it enables us to get at and handle the real case condition that is causing the client or student to behave in a losing, non-prospering way. </p> <p>But, most people experience withdrawal symptoms when they stray too far away from their chronic life traps.  Of course, they can take two aspirins or drink a bottle of whisky and gain temporary relief from the pain and hurt of the withdrawal.  But unless you run out the telepathically projected images and return the life-force particles, all your unusual solutions to handle the psychosomatic pains and anguish of near withdrawal will only add to the problem.</p> <p>Homesickness is a typical withdrawal symptom, as are heartbreak, anxiety attacks, chronic tiredness, and fits of depression. </p> <p>This telepathically projected life-force particle package is the reason the gods went into disguise.  This way they could not be found and repackaged and tagged.</p> <p>Therefore, if you want your full god-state back, you must persist and fulfill you mission to recreate the steps necessary for all to regain the love and abilities, skills, awareness, knowledge, purity, and truth of self so they can reunite with all other god-like beings so that one day the Supreme Being will be whole again.</p> <p>ALAN C.

<p>Violent entities   (And many, many more)</p> <p>It should be noted that mass murderers such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson, Henry Lucas and numerous other violent individuals all tried to explain their actions as having to do with having heard voices in their head.  It should also be noted that these people, including others such as Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Joseph Stalin, have all come out of incredibly abusive environments and in their formative years suffered great ridicule, pain and abandonment, and therefore sit at the bottom of the scale of identities and entities.  These individuals all had massive deep seated hatred toward their fellow man.</p> <p>One could take a visit to any maximum security prison that contains rapists, murderers and violent criminals, which I have done, and one will find the common denominator of all these people was an environment and family that contained unspeakable abuses and pain.  So much so that they had no attention available to study and therefore, there is a great deal of illiteracy amongst these people.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that violent, painful abuse, such as beatings, whippings, being locked in closets, starvation and sexual molestation and assaults, when constantly applied to a person at an early age generates unbelievable rage, hatred and self-hatred.  This stays contained until the person reaches adulthood, at which time these people act out this rage.</p> <p>What has happened is that their basic identities have been shattered, and even their bits of identities have been shattered.  They perceive their only hope is to adopt the identity of the abuser, and they take on the hatred of the abuser which is multiplied with their own hatred. This is how the very destructive identities are created.</p> <p>Cults often produce this kind of behavior on their followers, wherein they begin a cycle of isolationism, abuse, bad food (non-nutritious), and degradation of the follower\u2019s own goals, own dreams, own visions, and own identities.</p> <p>Usually in a cult the only identity that is considered worthwhile is the cult leader\u2019s and that cult leader\u2019s identity is the only one allowed.  This, of course, is impossible to attain, thus the follower is dependent on the cult for his identity, having been abused and made wrong, and  having had his own identity made worthless by the considerations of the cult.</p> <p>That is why when a follower leaves the cult he has such trouble as he has no personality, beingness or identity of this own, and any past personality, beingness, or identity that he did have was thoroughly degraded and made wrong.  This is a thoroughly disempowered state.</p> <p>Cults do not necessarily have to be large organizations.  Families can be cults wherein only the father\u2019s identity is OK, or only the mother\u2019s identity is OK.  Football teams can be cults when only the coach\u2019s identity is OK.  Even corporations can be cults.  Cultism is a deadly activity as it drops its followers way down this scale of identities and entities.</p> <p>The clients that you are handling are somewhere on this list, the majority being between your (their) own prime identity and culturally determined identities.  One must handle correctly the correct level or you can cause a serious degradation of the case.</p> <p>We all have billions and billions of identities covering every facet of existence from deities to the lowest forms of slime.  Some identities are good, some are bad, some aid survival, some hinder.  What we want is for the client to have power of choice over the creating and uncreating of their own prime identities.</p> <p>This is very specialized processing.  Done right, a 40 minute session can run out 10,000 lifetimes of bad existences and recover enormous amounts of spirita.</p> <p>This is the target of processing and only very superbly trained processors can run this.  There are vast amounts of case on all beings. To bring you back to complete wholeness, full operating potential and blissful happiness could take upwards of several thousand hours.  But it is very do-able.  It all depends on:  can you walk the road, be honest, cure your veering disease, push against the forces above your awareness, make the time and take the actions necessary to unlock and uncreate your own and other\u2019s creations.</p> <p>ALAN C.

They came in from outside at various points on the Grade Chart.</p> <p>Most came in for their next step. Many were OT III\u2019s and NOT\u2019s cases. These were usually the worse off cases. There were also many \u201cnatural clears.\u201d</p> <p>The sessions \u2018seemed\u2019 to go fairly well. The wins after session were OK. But not much changed in their life and livingness and in many cases things deteriorated.</p> <p>I came to the conclusion most of these former Scio\u2019s were trained session \u201cfakers\u201d and PR merchants.</p> <p>I have observed that success stories are far more revelatory than most other client information. Partially because you can observe the life increases or decreases in effectiveness almost immediately after a session. (Within a day or two.) More things going right. Unhandled long term problems magically resolving. Increases in responsibility, (job promotions.) Higher toned, etc. Their immediate prosperity, success and happiness in life should increase.</p> <p>Fake success stories immediately let\u2019s you know you are processing a fake case.</p> <p>Fake cases are made by fake releases and invalidation of true release points. Fake attestations and missed actual attestations. Fake F/N\u2019s and missed actual F/N\u2019s. Fake passes and invalidation of competency. Fake case handlings and invalidation of actual case handlings. Fake states attained and true states invalidated.</p> <p>Fake cases are created because it is unsafe or too dangerous to tell the truth. If the processing environment is dangerous the client will tend to PR their way out of trouble.</p> <p>The client has been or is trapped in a no-win technical, ethical and administrative situation.</p> <p>The client wants to get off the charge, wants to become more honest, but knows if they tell the absolute truth: i.e. \u201cI\u2019m not making any gains from this processing,\u201d they could end up in ethics, or whatever.  He or she runs the risk of being labeled a dissenter or worse an enemy of Scientology.</p> <p>This unsafe or too dangerous to tell the truth environment or situation produces a by-passed case phenomena.</p> <p>You possibly are saying to yourself that\u2019s crazy.

The optimum life repair put in the basics of life. It helped the client regain the knowledge and truth about who he really was, what he was doing or not doing and the actions needed to increase control and cause over their immediate life and dynamics.</p> <p>A good \u201cLife Repair\u201d usually takes between 50 to 150 hours. It also includes doing basic TR\u2019s and Upper Indoc type training.</p> <p>The long term success of a Mission, Org., or client could be said to depend totally on the quality of the \u201cLife Repair\u2019s\u201d it delivered. Because of the increase in the client and students cause and responsibility over their life would enable them to earn and afford more money, time and effort to invest in further training and processing. They could and would respect themselves enough to hold a position of more truth and make their life obey them.</p> <p>An effective \u201cLife Repair\u201d would begin to restore the clients self respect and sovereignty back to them.</p> <p>What I was observing was: A MASSIVE TACIT SABOTAGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY!</p> <p>MORE TO COME.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw53.html","title":"Cultural De-Oppression","text":"<p>Christine Norstrand wrote:</p> <p>Alan, Knowledgism need a goddam rundown on Gurus.</p> <p>It is part of the Cultural DeOppression and DeProgramming Procedures.</p> <p>The cycle goes approximately something like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Presence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Being sovereign.

The reason a DOT is a DOT is that they are living (if you could call it living) in a collapsed universe. </p> <p>Their mind is more powerful and bigger than they are; </p> <p>Their body is more powerful and bigger than they are; </p> <p>Their identity is more powerful and bigger than they are. </p> <p>They are in a compulsive/obsessive state of games playing. </p> <p>When a DOT comes into contact with a spiritual being in its natural, powerful, huge condition, the DOT is overwhelmed by immense pain, as it struggles to become on a parity with the natural, powerful spiritual being. </p> <p>The DOT has to get bigger than its mind, bigger than its body, and much bigger than its identity. </p> <p>Or, failing that, the DOT must cause the naturally powerful, huge being to collapse its own universe. </p> <p>The DOT convinces the naturally powerful, huge being that the DOT\u2019s identity is better than the naturally powerful, huge being. </p> <p>DOTs can be masterful manipulators. </p> <p>Most beings are DOTS in the area of relationships, and it is usually a fight over who can create the other into a DOT and control the other; dominate and subjugate them. </p> <p>Anyone who has a history of disastrous relationships knows the desperate</p> <p>fights to maintain their natural, powerful bigness and selfness, only to end up in a collapsed universe with everything and every dream destroyed. </p> <p>The basic cause of pain is \u201cA collapsed universe\u201d = a being has become a DOT. Its mind, its body, and its identity have become more powerful and\\ bigger than they are. </p> <p>Their honesty and integrity have been violated. </p> <p>The destructive dance of the DOTS is a deadly, vicious game. </p> <p>Just recently I watched two beings, who had both had long histories of disastrous relationships, engage in a destructive dance of the DOTS. </p> <p>The roller coaster effect on one of them was massive, and when they were totally caved in and minuscule, the other cemented them into their dotdom (the opposite of a kingdom) with sexual misconduct. </p> <p>The sheer degradation and evilness of the act was appalling to permeate. </p> <p>The girl completely caved in and lost completely all her dreams, creations, wins, and gains. She knew she was \u201ca worthless, useless slut.\u201d </p> <p>Her DOT partner had run the ultimate negative process. He had convinced her to violate all her Codes, virtues, and principles. </p> <p>The man (ha!) pretends to be a helper and a powerful being. It was truly a demonstration of the false and degrading activity of a vicious, deadly, negative processor. He, too, has betrayed and violated all his Codes, virtues, and principles. </p> <p>DOTS are deadly; they are silent; they operate by altering, silently and covertly, their spiritual, powerful beingness into the unimportance of an identity, collapsing the other being\u2019s universe, plunging the other being into chaos and pain. </p> <p>What they sell are big pictures of pretended spirituality; what they deliver is a false identity that makes the identity more important than the being. </p> <p>Anyone who makes the mind, the body, the identity more important than the huge, powerful, able, brilliant, intelligent, massively multi-talented spiritual or god-like being that every being is, is a destructive DOT. </p> <p>Sick parents, especially those who are practitioners of the professions such as doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists; New Agers, cultists, and counselors who pretend to be spiritual helpers but who are, in fact, DOTS. </p> <p>But the most deadly saboteur is the manipulative super-salesman, for they are experts at convincing you that you are nothing and that you must be like them to succeed, but to be like them, you must be a DOT and give all your power away to an identity or body. </p> <p>Identities are valuable, but nowhere near as valuable as the god-like, powerful, natural, huge, giant being that is innate in every spiritual being on planet Earth.</p> <p>Let us destroy DOTISM. Let us be our fully whole, spiritual, god-like selves and help others to be their full, god-like, spiritual selves. </p> <p>Let\u2019s quit dancing the destructive dances of the DOTS. </p>"},{"location":"acw66.html#the-de-dot-procedures-presence-one","title":"THE DE-DOT PROCEDURES \u2014 PRESENCE ONE:","text":"<p>1\u2013 Define: PRESENCE. </p> <p>2 \u2014 Clear the client on PRESENCE.

(HCOB 19 Aug 63)</p> <p>The end of case could then be defined as: </p> <p>END OF CASE, all by-passed charge erased or eliminated.</p> <p>It then is possible to have end of case phenomena occur quite often.</p> <p>The way the Universes seem to have been constructed is in specific containers or boxes.</p> <p>The way a being descended is to so fill their container or boxes with BPC that they split or disconnected from the original container or box and made another. The splits would be the end of that game and the boxes would be the container of the next game, these splits to boxes would span the full spectrum of the Zones (Top of the Gold Zone to the bottom of the Red Zone) or all scales from the top to the bottom.</p> <p>A box could be defined as the full games package container ALL the parts needed to play the games of life. From game-makers, game, playing field, players, umpires, spectators, etc.</p> <p>Each split to box was a complete unit unto itself.</p> <p>As the box became filled with more and more BPC, the beings and games would degenerate into unsolvable problems and solidified BPC (Mass). Bringing about an enforced end of game phenomena. </p> <p>The being or beings solved this by splitting and creating a new lesser box. The dwindling cycle.</p> <p>The activity of effective processing and training is the reversal of this dwindling cycle.</p> <p>Thus it is possible to experience \u201cEnd of case\u201d phenomena as you achieve the erasure of the box you are operating in. In other words no BPC in your present box.</p> <p>The first time this happened to me was in 1962.</p> <p>I had taken every area of my life into mastery. (A pretty low grade level of mastery) but for the box I was in, top of the Gold Zone. My football career was at its peak, my business was doing tremendous, my finances were beyond all expectations. (I was earning the equivalent of todays income about $20,000 a week.)</p> <p>My relationships and communication lines were the top of the Australian Org Board. My business partners were Olympic Gold Medalists and Wimbeldon champions.</p> <p>I was caseless.</p> <p>Then one day I was playing football on the MCG in the first ever nationally televised game to an audience of approx 5 million people. It was the best game I ever played........Suddenly I was outside the whole game (exterior with full perceptics) an unthinkable thought flashed through \u201cwhat the hell was I doing running around in my underwear chasing a bag of wind, and what were all these people doing watching people running around in there underwear chasing bags of wind.\u201d</p> <p>It was the end of my humanoid game.</p> <p>At that moment everything began to unravel....I went from the top of the Gold Zone as a humanoid to the bottom of the Red Zone as spirit.</p> <p>Within a few days all my games had ceased to be worthwhile.</p> <p>It was then I decided to go to England and take on Scio full time.</p> <p>This I did.</p> <p>The next time I experienced caselessness was in 1969.</p> <p>Again I was in a state of exterior with full perceptics.</p> <p>At that time I had 10 Missions, numerous other business interests, lived in Beverly Hills having a house that was on the highest point of BH with spectacular 380 degree views.</p> <p>My Missions had 46 Class VIII\u2019s, about 60 Class VI\u2019s and 760 fully paid SHSBC students in training. The Missions spanned the US. I was also a SO Officer.</p> <p>Again the unthinkable thought. \u201cthe way Scio is designed won\u2019t work.\u201d Another End Of game phenomena.</p> <p>Again I moved (crashed) from the Gold Zone into a Red Zone.</p> <p>Only this time it took me till 1982 to find the new direction or box. I sat in massive BPC until 1986.</p> <p>There have been many sub periods of caselessness....but they were fairly short term 3 or 4 years.</p> <p>Alan</p>"},{"location":"acw69.html","title":"Case Handling Difficulties","text":"<p>At 01:56 PM 6/21/98 -0400, Homer Wilson Smith wrote:</p> <p>At 05:25 PM 6/20/98 -0400, Homer Wilson Smith wrote:</p> <p>Well I was born by two people who should have had their sexual organs removed at birth, so I have some charge on the subject of people breeding for fun and escape.</p> <p>Lighten up indeed.</p> <p>How very psychoanalytic of you.</p> <p>Have you had psychoanalytic counselling?</p> <p>Not officially.

Manufactured by the body, it is found along with its receptor sites in the brain, blood platelets, and lining of the digestive tract.  It is also a precursor to a hormone called melatonin, which plays multiple life-giving roles in the body, including regulating biological rhythms.  Neurotransmitters send message (electrical impulses) from one nerve cell to another.  Serotonin is believed to be more than simply a messenger, because it affects a wide range of mental and physical responses in the body and plays a significant role in activities such as temperature regulation, hunger sensations, sexual behavior, and sleep patterns.  Serotonin deficiencies can give rise to a wide range of illnesses, depending on what part of the brain is affected.</p> <p>Serotonin is known as the \u201cmood molecule\u201d because it modulates raw information and gives it its emotional tone.  James Stockard, a Northwestern University psychiatrist, stated, \u201cA person\u2019s mood is like a symphony, and serotonin is like the conductor\u2019s baton.\u201d  For example, serotonin levels in the brain determine whether we will perceive a glass of water as being half-empty or half-full.  Other neurotransmitters may give the message that we are full, but serotonin levels determine if we feel satisfied.  Low serotonin levels in the brain are linked to clinical depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive behaviors (such as overeating), bulimia, schizophrenia, sleep problems, migraine headaches, autism, drug and alcohol addictions, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and patterns of violent behavior.  The conditions listed above may miraculously disappear or improve significantly when serotonin levels are raised.</p>"},{"location":"acw72.html","title":"Drugs","text":"<p>On Sat, 18 Jul 1998, Alan C.

It also must be understood LRH\u2019s support staff was less than 10 people at Saint Hill. Not only was he being attacked by Life mag., but several Govermental enquiries were also underway. One of which led to the banning of Scio in Victoria, Australia. LRH\u2019s ruds were definitely out.</p> <p>But I believe the repercussions are much deeper than that, it was from then on that LRH began to operate from a Dominators viewpoint, slowly the freedoms and safety began to disappear.

The 3 people spun in as soon as they returned home. LRH at that time was completely out of valence. He was in constant rage and fury for the whole 3 weeks of the Class VIII course. Tech had sunk to its lowest point. It was also on the Class VIII course that auditing the pc in front of you was abandoned.

I also have audited former drug users over the years.  Although, never one actually on crack cocaine.  I have only heard tales about crack, like \u201conce you are on it you never lose the desire to have it again.\u201d  you can never get away from it\u201d  \u201cthe only way you ever get away from it is to die\u201d.  \u201cthere is never a moment that you don\u2019t think about getting it\u201d  \u201cyou will do ANYTHING to get more.\u201d etc. </p> <p>So, I had been looking at her for the last few weeks with those ideas in my head. </p> <p>When I read Alans Cult materials, I realized that those precepts kept me from even trying to approach the subject of helping her. </p> <p>So, last week, I told her that if she really wanted to get off the stuff, to give me a call and maybe we could do something.  I told her that what I learned in Dallas was not necessarily drug rehab material, but spiritual rehab material. </p> <p>I told her that I wanted her to know that I knew she was a spiritual being and that I love her.  That I would be working with her as a spiritual being. </p> <p>I told her that I was not interested in wasting my time and knowledge on a lost cause.  If she felt like she really wanted to get cleaned up and grow as a spiritual being , give me a call. </p> <p>Last night she was leaving her mom\u2019s house as I had arrived for a visit.  I already knew she was messed up.  About an hour later, she came back and said that she really wanted to get straight.  She was coming down, and having a pretty rough time of it.  Very distraught and emotional, heart hurting and racing, disoriented, etc. </p> <p>Did Hug assists and locationals. </p> <p>Touch that tree was the most effective. </p> <p>Looking at something was not even possible at that time. </p> <p>After some time she calmed down enough to get through the night. </p> <p>I told her that if she wanted to find out if we could do something about this to come to my house at 10:00 am tomorrow (today). </p> <p>At ten sharp she arrived, I acknowledged her for being at the right place at the right time with the right person.  Immediately her indicators came it. </p> <p>Good start!! </p> <p>Did some brief orientation as to what processing was about. </p> <p>Looked up a few words, and had her to locate where she was on the chart of ascension, and we were off and running presence. (Presence Paridigm Technology from the Web page) </p> <p>This was a great process to start her off on. ( I had never run this one before, by the way)  She was quite over accessed by the drug use, and this process was perfect to begin de-accessing her. </p> <p>Went through it numerous times.  She was amazed that she was able to \u201copen up\u201d to me.  She said she has had lots of \u201cdrug counseling\u201d and she had never before opened up to anyone about herself.\u201d  She said this was really different that what she had done it the past, all they wanted to do was focus on the drug, all she wanted to do was focus on the problems she had that made her want to do the drug in the first place. </p> <p>Handled some unpleasant sensations and identities also.  It was a grueling three and a half hours because so much was accessed to begin with.  But, she hung in there. </p> <p>The pain and racing of heart subsided.  The throbbing in her head went away.  She said at this very minute, she did not have a want for crack. Did not know what the next minute would be, but was pleased that she did not want it at this moment.</p> <p>She had lost the pasty look in her face.  Her eyes showed life.  And she said she felt much much better than when she came. </p> <p>So, we called it a day. </p> <p>We will see what tomorrow brings.  10:00 sharp. </p> <p>Love, Marlene</p>"},{"location":"acw81.html","title":"Drug Recovery 2","text":"<p>This is number 2. </p> <p>The processes Marlene mentioned can be found on: </p> <p>http:/www.knowledgism.com</p> <p>Alan</p> <p>Yes, the processes ARE working! </p> <p>Since I have last written, we have handled some identities, most notable changes were upon running \u201ccrackhead\u201d identity on Presence 4.  Also, picking up the unpleasant sensations for that. </p> <p>Prior to that session, she has originated that she still wants the crack. </p> <p>After running that she says she has not wanted it.  She had major release of force from that one. </p> <p>Much relief. </p> <p>She has two young children.  Yesterday, she recognized that she was present with them.  A simple thing made her so happy.  They jumped rope and played. </p> <p>The first time she has been \u201cpresent\u201d with her children\u2026for a very long time, if ever.  But, for fifteen minutes, she said, she was really present. </p> <p>Upon going into session yesterday, she was still really winning and feeling peaceful and good.  So I decided to do something a bit different.  We ran Restoration of Wants process from the Super Being Power Processing Course. </p> <p>She chose her daughter as the item she was interested in running first. </p> <p>This process bit!!  She did holographic permeation like a pro. </p> <p>She felt the pain she has caused her daughter. She understood how her daughter feels.</p> <p>She came out of that session with renewed love and understanding for her child. </p> <p>She recognized that she had been absent for the first five years of her daughter\u2019s life. </p> <p>Spiritually absent. </p> <p>During that session she arrived enough to fully duplicate her daughter\u2019s viewpoint, experience the pain and emotions and recognize and accept responsibility for having caused that pain and those emotions. </p> <p>Last night I took my client with me on an overnight stay out of town.  So we got an evening session in. (the one I just spoke of) </p> <p>Today we came home.  When her daughter saw her, there was the most tremendous welcome from her. (in the past she has withdrawn from her mommie and clung to her grandmother) </p> <p>Her beautiful little daughter looked up at me and said. </p> <p>You have brought me a NEW mommie! </p> <p>Tonight she is home with her children enjoying them for the first time in a long time. </p> <p>Her mother is with her for good measure.  She is cleaning her house and putting order in her surroundings. </p> <p>Tomorrow we go back into session for more! </p> <p>One thing she would like to handle is when she tries to go to sleep at night, \u201cher mind goes a hundred miles an hour\u201d  (probably freewheeling) </p> <p>Any suggested process to help handle that?  Or just keep on unburdening? </p> <p>Oh, one thing more.  This afternoon, I pulled up my Greenzone letters and let her take a look at the encouragement and love she was getting from people she does not even know. </p> <p>She was so touched.  She kept saying, those people do not even know me, and they are wanting to help and encourage me. </p> <p>Thank you all. </p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Marlene</p>"},{"location":"acw82.html","title":"Drug Recovery 3","text":"<p>Number 3. </p> <p>Alan</p> <p>Dear Ron and Denise,</p> <p>Thank you for your heartfelt support.

(+: </p> <p>I will keep posting as we continue.  At nearly a week into this, I have real reason to be optimistic for my client\u2019s recovery. </p> <p>I think the most vital thing that occurred at the onset of this was that she asked for the help.  I had told her previously that I might know of something that might help, did not even know for sure.  I told her this technology was not particularly designed for rehabilitating the addict, that it was designed to rehabilitate the spiritual being. </p> <p>Every bit of processing I have done with her is directed at the spiritual being, and I have been very consistant in relaying that to her, even though she had no idea prior to this processing that she was a spiritual being. </p> <p>The very first thing I did was to acknowledge her as a spiritual being by announcing to her that I knew that she was one. </p> <p>This may have been the first time she has ever been acknowledged for her existance as a spiritual being. </p> <p>I know this is early on in her processing, but, I must say to her credit that she has shown remarkable determinism and courage.  Her withdrawal symptoms have been minimal compared to what she went through in past \u201crehab facilities.\u201d </p> <p>I believe that is because we addressed the unpleasant sensations connected to the \u201ccrackhead\u201d identity.  (Handled it with Presence 4 for troublesome identities.) </p> <p>She handled huge amounts of force during the processing. </p> <p>I have seen no sign of her creating that identity since that session.  She now is more interested in doing processing to get bigger and bigger as a being, as she puts it. </p> <p>If she shows interest in pursuing drug related subjects, we will, of course, but right now her interest lies in what she can do to better herself and become a more valuable person to her family and to the world.  So that is the direction we are heading in. </p> <p>I\u2019ll keep you posted. </p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Marlene</p> <p>Dear Marlene:</p> <p>This really is well done.  I admire this because eventually I\u2019m  thinking of getting in touch with some people I know who are doing the  12 step programs (AA, ACA there are several of them) and introducing  them to Knowledgism techniques.  So, of course I was quite interested  with what you had succeeded in doing.

Albiet, today is only the ninth day since she last took crack, but since the second day of processing she says she has no desire for the crack, unlike before. </p> <p>She had a diminished appetite for those first two days, but since has been eating normal meals.  Since I am not a nutritionist, I did not suggest any dietary or vitamin changes or even suggestions. </p> <p>Quite probably she was not in nearly as bad a condition physically as was the person of which you speak. </p> <p>From what I have observed and from what she has told me, she has no desire for the crack at this time. </p> <p>I did not even consider body comm or touch assists for her unpleasant sensations. </p> <p>It was handled at a spiritual level rather than a body level.  Unpleasant sensations came up on the Identity handling that we did. </p> <p>When I first decided to take her as a client.  I did not have a clue as what to do. </p> <p>So I observed what was going on with her and handled what was there at that very minute.  She was disoriented, I had her go outside and practically hug a tree. </p> <p>It was there, standing still, big enough to hang on to, and she did.  It just seemed like the right thing to do.  I held her and told her I loved her.  I let her cry, I heard what she said, and the moment SHE asked for my help I made myself available. </p> <p>She was at her mother\u2019s home at the time.  She was still coming down from the drug. </p> <p>I told her that I wanted her to go take a bath, clean up, eat or drink something if she could and go to bed.  I assured her that she would be safe at her mother\u2019s house for the night.  I then turned responsibility for herself over to her.  I said if in the morning you still want help you be at my house at 10:00.  She came, exactly 10:00. </p> <p>As an aside, I am familiar with the Body Comm, touch assist, etc.  In my judgement that was not the proper handling.  To me it would have driven her further inward to go looking around in that poisoned body.  She certainly did not need further introversion, in my opinion. </p> <p>I have heard a hundred times (or more) in Knowledgism, to handle the person in front of you.  So, I set aside any idea of a set program to do for her. </p> <p>Sometimes I feel like I am flying by the seat of my pants, but, so far, I have been spot on. </p> <p>Now keep in mind this is a person who has had zero training or processing in the past.  So, sometimes she gets a crash course, even if it is verbal, to get her enough understanding to run the process. </p> <p>We have been averaging 3-3 \u00bd hours a day working together on this.  Some days we process.  Some days we listen to tapes. </p> <p>(Miracles and Magic) (Chronic Addiction to Abuse) And (Ascension Experience Phenomenon)  You may say that last tape was a bit steep a gradient, but there were things on that tape that answered questions she had.  Some of it is not quite real to her yet, but she is quite happy to come back and listen to it again as she knows more. </p> <p>In processing, at the moment that she realized that she no longer wanted the crack. (Apparently this drug is one that makes a person want it 24-7) </p> <p>This phenomenon has ceased. </p> <p>We have run processes like Attaining Presence, Presence 3, Presence 4.  Confusion and Mass handling, Restoration of Wants process. etc. </p> <p>Rick, I haven\u2019t gotten around to SPIEPIR yet, but I won\u2019t be surprised if that is not soon on the agenda.  Good suggestion. </p> <p>(Charlie, if you are reading this, would you send me a copy of the first Abuse tape, I don\u2019t have a copy at the present.) </p> <p>Who knows what we will run tomorrow.  We will figure that out tomorrow by finding out what she wants to handle. </p> <p>There has not been a lengthy \u201cdrug handling\u201d program.  I figured when she said she did not want the drug it was handled.  (Setting aside my ideas from the past that it would be a lengthy program)  We are doing a Spiritual Being handling. </p> <p>Let me tell you of some of the changes in her life. I have already in a previous post mentioned her reconciliation with her 5 year old daughter.  (A crack baby, by the way). </p> <p>Her daughter\u2019s belligerant attitude has subsided. </p> <p>Her 3 year old son (She did not do crack during that pregnancy) had a blank dull look to his eyes and big dark circles under his eyes. </p> <p>Magically, he is bright eyed the dark circles have disappeared. </p> <p>She has a major new word in her vocabulary.  Consequences!! </p> <p>She is starting to look at possible consequences of her actions both positive and negative, and is now making decisions based on consequences and willingness to be responsible for consequences before she acts. </p> <p>She has cleaned her house from head to toe, gotten her yard presentable, has gotten back into communication with some of the people she has hurt by her actions, and is in the process of repairing those relationships. </p> <p>There are many more improvements going on, but I will let her tell you of them soon. </p> <p>I am sure she will post here soon. </p> <p>By the way, she has read the posts here and really appreciates the love and support that the Greenzoners are giving her. </p> <p>I do not know what tomorrow brings for her.  I know that this surely can not pass as any kind of \u201cclinical test\u201d as a drug treatment.  I do know that today she is not in as much spiritual pain as she was 10 days ago.  I do know that she has been clean and sober for nine days.  I do know that she has taken taken steps forward. </p> <p>I do know that the results that I have observed so far are so fast and furious that even I am amazed.  I know I have never seen anything like it in my past experience in dealing with persons who have a drug history. </p> <p>I am so thankful that Alan has developed this technology so I could help this neighborhood girl I have known and loved since she was three years old. </p> <p>She has had nine days of peace that she has not known since she was a small child by starting to handle the Abuse that occured prior to her ever taking that first drug. </p> <p>More than ever I understand when Alan says, process the person in front of you. </p> <p>Alan, you have my utmost love and respect. </p> <p>Marlene</p> <p>To: Elizabeth &amp; Dan Barber</p> <p>I was a Narconon ED for about 2 years back in the late 70\u2019s. I ran a  prison program most of this time but did do a couple of heroin withdrawals. These  can be very serious to a persons health. I had one almost die on me. They  take 24 hour care with lots of body comms (almost continuosly). Medical  assistance was also required and I had to use it once for intravenous  feeding. This guy was pretty addicted and could not keep in even liquids.</p> <p>Also use lots of vitamins.</p> <p>He made it through but I don\u2019t think he stayed off. They require in  patient treatment after the withdrawal with comm drills, touch assists, (things to  get back in comm with the body) so someone can watch them and he couldn\u2019t  stay for that. The urges for drugs are still there and can turn on pretty  strong.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if I can help very much but I sure respect anyone who tries  getting people off. I do think Alans presence drills are better than the  old TR\u2019s. Maybe even SPIEPER would work.</p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Rick Johnson </p>"},{"location":"acw85.html","title":"Drug Recovery 6","text":"<p>Number 6: From the client. </p> <p>Alan</p> <p>Dear Greenzoners,</p> <p>This the second time we have composed this e-mail.

I told her that as far as I know that you and Eric are the only two persons in the world delivering the Codes.  And even explained to her briefly about what I know of the Codes, that they help you find your reason for living. </p> <p>She said \u201d I have always wanted to help other people, and here I am the one needing help\u201d  We\u2019ll just file that one away for when she finds her codes and compare notes. </p> <p>Brought in her indicators at this level. </p> <p>We have felt your presence, as we were sitting in the room speaking of you. </p> <p>Thank you for being here. </p> <p>I have explained to her that as far as I know, this is the first time that the Knowledgism tech has been used in handling a Crack Cocaine addiction.  And, as we sat here together we both realized the enormity of taking on this processing and putting it out to view to the eyes of the world. </p> <p>And it is really OK with both of us.  We are willing to be responsible the effects that our work may have on other beings.  Andrea even saw that she had a responsibiliy to others to share her experience, in hopes of helping others. </p> <p>As she has said.  She does not know if she is free from \u201cWanting crack\u201d  forever, but she has had twelve days completely free of that want.  That is twelve days more than she has had since she started using it some 8 or so years ago. </p> <p>Even though she had a period of three years that she did not use it. The Wanting it was there 24-7. </p> <p>The identity handling is the processing that addressed that issue. </p> <p>The \u201cCrackhead\u201d identity was bigger than she was, and it wanted crack. </p> <p>We have now gone on to processing the being for what she wants handled, just like any other client. </p> <p>We are addressing heavy areas of abuse that occurred when she was a small child. </p> <p>One particular type of abuse, so destroyed her that she created a \u201cnobody\u201d  identity just to get through childhood. </p> <p>And we have handled other identites. </p> <p>It was though there were a series of identities that culminated in the creation of the \u201ccrackhead\u201d identity. Each designed to protect her from the pain of remembering the abuse. </p> <p>She has realized that she has been absent since she was about three years old, when the terrible abuse first started. </p> <p>She is now willing to be present and to face the terrible truth head on. </p> <p>She is beginning to understand why she did not tell anyone what was happening. </p> <p>The consequences were too great.  (The consequences being that her family would be killed if she ever told anyone.) </p> <p>She always felt guilty for allowing it to happen again after the first episode.  She realized that by being the Victim, she has every day of her troubled life pointed the finger at him. </p> <p>Look what he did to me. He destroyed my life.  But, in essence what she was doing was protecting her family from harm. </p> <p>She realized that she really was strong to have been able to protect her family from danger. </p> <p>As a child, the danger was real and ever present. </p> <p>Then she realized that he did not destroy her!!! </p> <p>What I am seeing in this processing is the role that identities play in addiction. </p> <p>From where I see it.  The being is absent, and the identity(s) and the accompaning unpleasant sensations take over the life of of the person. </p> <p>The substance used keeps the being away as to not experience the unpleasant sensations. Thus the cycle of addiction occurs. </p> <p>I see handling addiction as nothing more complicated than sorting out those identities, making them smaller and the being bigger. </p> <p>The being is not addicted. </p> <p>The identities sure are.  But, that is not the end of the processing.  Once the identity(s) are small and the being is larger, then you handle the difficuly the being had prior to the addictive cycle. </p> <p>Then most importantly educate, educate, educate the being so he/she can handle life\u2019s problems as they arise.  And the bottom line is presence. </p> <p>I may be naive, but that is as difficult as I see it (addiction) to be. </p> <p>You get the addictive identity(s) out of the way and you process and train the being. </p> <p>By the way if you continue looking at him/her as an addict, and continue processing the addict, (not the spiritual being) you will have a rehabbed addict. (still an addict) </p> <p>If you process the spiritual being, you will have a rehabbed spiritual being (still a being) </p> <p>I no longer see Andrea as a Crack Addict.  I see her as a spiritual being.  And the great part is so does she!! </p> <p>It would be easy to create that identity again, so we are going to use every process known to God and Alan Walter, to keep it from replicating.  Me thinks the cult series processes might be a good tool for that one. </p> <p>The beauty of this all is that every bit of the processing we have done is from the processes on the Website, available to everyone.  The tapes we have listened to are available through the website. </p> <p>The most difficult obstacle to overcome was the idea that nothing could be done about it.  How do we know if we do not try? </p> <p>We will either succeed or fail at this.  Success may not be guaranteed, ( at this point), but, failure certainly can be guaranteed if you do not even try. </p> <p>I am betting on success. </p> <p>Love, Marlene</p> <p>Hello Marlene.</p> <p>I feel you have acknowledged in print the wrong person, confusing me, John  Mace with Richard Johnson, probably because of his e.mail address.</p> <p>It is an interesting occurrence though because although I have not said so  in print I have only the greatest admiration and respect for what you have  done and are doing for Andrea and have been intending to comm with you to  validate and acknowledge you.  </p> <p>Anyhow, although my great love is finding peoples\u2019 codes and most of my  energies go into that, what you have done for Andrea has caused me to have  a look at whether I should offer my expertise to some drug handling agency  here in Perth....... I do not particularly want to personally handle addicts because as I have just said my interests lie in delivering the codes, but  what has crossed my mind is training some drug counsellors on Knowledgism  tech. They would have ample back-up. With this in mind I am filing your  postings and will continue to do so. At the end of the line I will  approach the so called \u2018authorities\u2019.</p> <p>Your postings are great, they come from the heart instead of being some  cold clinical treatise and the one from Andrea is of similar vein.</p> <p>You made the comment that what you are doing could hardly be called a  clinical test, well I differ wih that view; every clinical test has to  start somewhere and you have started and in the public gaze at that. </p> <p>Another thing is that by your postings you are creating a \u2018clinical\u2019   history so keep them going.</p> <p>Give each other a hug for me.

explain their actions as having to do with having heard voices in their head.  It should also be noted that these people, including others such as Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Joseph Stalin, have all come out of incredibly abusive environments and in their formative years suffered great ridicule, pain and abandonment, and therefore sit at the bottom of the scale of identities and entities.  These individuals all had massive deep seated hatred toward their fellow man.</p> <p>One could take a visit to any maximum security prison that contains rapists, murderers and violent criminals, which I have done, and one will find the common denominator of all these people was an environment and family that contained unspeakable abuses and pain.  So much so that they had no attention available to study and therefore, there is a great deal of illiteracy amongst these people.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that violent, painful abuse, such as beatings, whippings, being locked in closets, starvation and sexual molestation and assaults, when constantly applied to a person at an early age generates unbelievable rage, hatred and self-hatred.  This stays contained until the person reaches adulthood, at which time these people act out this rage.</p> <p>What has happened is that their basic identities have been shattered, and even their bits of identities have been shattered.  They perceive their only hope is to adopt the identity of the abuser, and they take on the hatred of the abuser which is multiplied with their own hatred. This is how the very destructive identities are created.</p> <p>Cults often produce this kind of behavior on their followers, wherein they begin a cycle of isolationism, abuse, bad food (non-nutritious), and degradation of the follower\u2019s own goals, own dreams, own visions, and own identities.</p> <p>Usually in a cult the only identity that is considered worthwhile is the cult leader\u2019s and that cult leader\u2019s identity is the only one allowed.  This, of course, is impossible to attain, thus the follower is dependent on the cult for his identity, having been abused and made wrong, and  having had his own identity made worthless by the considerations of the cult.</p> <p>That is why when a follower leaves the cult he has such trouble as he has no personality, beingness or identity of this own, and any past personality, beingness, or identity that he did have was thoroughly degraded and made wrong.  This is a thoroughly disempowered state.</p> <p>Cults do not necessarily have to be large organizations.  Families can be cults wherein only the father\u2019s identity is OK, or only the mother\u2019s identity is OK.  Football teams can be cults when only the coach\u2019s identity is OK.  Even corporations can be cults.  Cultism is a deadly activity as it drops its followers way down this scale of identities and entities.</p> <p>The clients that you are handling are somewhere on this list, the majority being between your (their) own prime identity and culturally determined identities.

T\u2019s clients, whom I\u2019ve been giving him several case advises a week on.  I had met her last year when I was in xxxx and knew instantly she was a heavy abuse case.  Well, a couple weeks ago the abuse started to surface (her childhood had been all black up until then) and when it did she started having screaming nightmares, terror during the day, and her life and business fell apart.</p> <p>After several long sessions of Observe/Rather not observe on her childhood it all came to view (lots of abuse) and then all the evil intended, abusive voices in her head came to the fore.  I advised C.T. to run Virulent Teammate handling, which he did, and the following win was the result.</p> <p>(A point of interest: Her business name is xxxxx xxxxx and she sells occult, black magic, and ritualists stuff, and she also has done the gory special effects for a number of movies.  )</p> <p>Now that she\u2019s out of the charge I\u2019ve advised C.T.  to just work on her setups and positives and continue her training.  She\u2019s been hanging in there getting her basics in and Clean Slating other clients for C.  in spite of all this sitting there, so I thinks with it discharged and out of the way she should be able to really make some progress.</p> <p>Anyway, I thought you\u2019d like to read a win from one of our field group\u2019s clients for a change.</p> <p>Eric</p> <p>Date: Tue, 29 Jun 1999 12:27:18 -0700 From: G To: Eric Woolery eric@knowledgism.com CC: C.

My thoughts are stemming from a whole new perspective, one of cool, peaceful calm. One in which control and hesitation aren\u2019t the ground rules. </p> <p>The suffocating panic and fear I have fought against forever has moved aside. It\u2019s as if from a child\u2019s open eyes and delight I am observing a new world. I never suspected that the rose-colored glasses I worked so hard to keep in place, were simply another form of blinders.   </p> <p>What you do is incredible. I can only imagine what it must be like for you to watch what the touch of your gift produces in others.  Your ability to discern what to do, where to go, for each different person\u2026thank you for advising on my case.  Thank you for taking the time with C, thank you for giving him directions for getting us out of the quicksand I continuously got us mired in.</p> <p>I really want you to know my appreciation and love for you, Mr. Walters and those in Dallas, most of whom I never met.  Your caring, support and knowledge have seeped all the way out here, touched me in a way I could have never before imagined.</p> <p>You have an incredible boulder moving, life creating person out here in C. He rolls up his sleeves, wades right in there with you, and somehow, when you think you have taken your last breath, he helps you see the rope that has been right there all along. The rope on which to  pull yourself up and out with. His gentle, caring intention and dedication to his purpose is breathtaking. I wish you could see it.    </p> <p>I am looking forward to the time when I come out to take courses there, in Dallas.

As one approaches the bottom of the Red Zone you come close to the infinity of materialism.</p> <p>For a Chart to align the following go to:</p> <p>http://www.knowledgism.com/profile.html</p> <p>Mid way in the Yellow Zone is the point of split for a beingness or identity. </p> <p>From the levels of existence Development to Presence spans the positive beingness or identity. </p> <p>From the levels of existence Stability to Absence spans the negative beingness or identity.</p> <p>Between Development and Stability  or more exactly between Antagonism (positive emotion) and Anger (negative emotion) is usually where the SET UP becomes an UPSET.</p> <p>When a being has become UPSET they have in actuality switched by splitting into negative identities or beingness. Splitting from a positive identity or beingness to becoming a negative identity or beingness.</p> <p>To get any power the negative identity or beingness must have a positive identity or beingness to oppose.</p> <p>The bigger the SET UP the bigger the UPSET. The more destructive are the negative identities or beingnesses.</p> <p>For example if you belonged to a Game and Organization that promised you everything you desired then you found out after spending several years of study and practice that the Organization did not deliver what it promised........you will get very upset.......now you are in opposition to your own positive identity that was trained and developed as a positive identity or beingness while you were part of the Organization and that Game. You now begin to develop a negative identity or beingness towards that Organization and Game and your previous positive identity you created to play that Game. </p> <p>The negative identity or beingness will be used to attempt to get rid of the earlier identity or beingness or Organization and Game. It is at this point that trouble starts as the negative identity or beingness you are now using does not process out the earlier Game, Organization or identity or beingness but instead tries to force, deny, obliterate, implode, explode, lie, vanish by obfuscation, forget, etc., in the attempt to make it go away.</p> <p>What this causes is added mass and charge to people, places, subjects and things connected to the Game, Organization and players, plus a loss of power, loss of awareness, loss of cleverness, loss of abilities, (you must not use the knowledge or abilities you acquired in the previous identity or beingness, Organization or Game.) loss of strength, loss of intelligence and loss of size of game, loss of size of identity, loss of reach, etc.</p> <p>Any Game, Organization, identity or beingness can become unwanted if that Game, Organization, identity or beingness becomes enforced or takes away the sovereignty of the players.</p> <p>The added mass and charge to people, places, subjects and things connected to the Game, Organization and players can destroy your ability to be - do - and have in these areas.</p> <p>The charge lays in the SET UP or positive areas, the UPSET or negative areas are just points of misdirection or veering disease. The UPSET gets its power from the SET UP area. Take all the charge out of the SET UP areas and the UPSETS just unravel.</p> <p>More importantly, if the charge is taken off the SET UPS you now have the ability to inspect and have power of choice over the area.</p> <p>If you focus on the UPSET you will by-pass the charge in the SET UP area. Now you have two areas of by-passed charged. The by-passed charge contained in the SET UPS and the falsely handled and misplaced by-passed charge of the UPSETS.</p> <p>The SET UPS preceded the UPSET. That is the SET UP is more basic than the UPSET.</p> <p>Very few people can grasp this....they all tend to fixate on the UPSET or wrongness. </p> <p>The usual operating basis of most people is to seek and find wrongnesses or UPSETS on others.</p> <p>The precept is \u201celiminate the wrongness and it will be right.\u201d Nothing is farther from the truth, the correct or winning precept would be; \u201cseek and find the correctness or truth, honor this and life will go right.\u201d  Using this method most cases and conditions will disolve effortlessly, plus you are the processing the client from the top down.</p> <p>The top being the point of most truth or basic origination point of the sequence of events.</p> <p>Alan</p> <p>Homer Wilson SmithNews, Web, Telnet Art Matrix - Lightlink (607) 277-0959    E-mail, FTP, ShellInternet Access, Ithaca NY homer@lightlink.com    info@lightlink.comhttp://www.lightlink.com</p>"},{"location":"acw9.html","title":"The 29 Vital Upward Steps","text":"<pre><code>---------- Forwarded message ----------\nDate: Mon, 09 Jun 1997 17:14:33 -0500\nFrom: Alan Walter &lt;wisdom@cyberstation.net&gt;\nTo: \"Homer W.

We are Spiritual Beings having a human experience.\u201d</p> <p>Teilhard de Chardin</p> <p>As you travel along life\u2019s pathways, you can either travel it in disintegration, poverty and sadness or you can travel it in wholeness, prosperity and happiness. </p> <p>To travel it in wholeness, prosperity and happiness requires a great deal of work and dedication, plus the ability to fully handle \u201cEpisodes of Abuse.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cAbuse Episodes\u201d are in themselves very destructive events. </p> <p>The ABUSER\u2019S intentions are: To disintegrate, to destructively control, to take over and dominate, to subjugate, to make wrong, to destroy, to prevent the working of, to upset, and to stop, in order to dismantle the spiritual, mental or physical operating machinery and psychic power and communication lines of you, the being. </p> <p>The ABUSER implements this by: Negatively processing you by creating and utilizing an \u201cAbuse Episode\u201d to introduce and force into your time and space something you do not WANT \u2014 \u201cAn Alien Unwanted Want or Object.\u201d </p> <p>The end product of the ABUSE is: The disempowerment and disintegration of your spiritual machinery, your mind and mental machinery and the physical machinery of your body. </p> <p>This causes you to lose your spiritual, mental and physical universe psychic communication lines, collapsing you into failure, poverty and deep sadness or unreality of you the spirit, your mind, your body and your psychic communication lines.</p> <p>THE \u201cABUSE EPISODE\u201d </p> <p>When an \u201cAbuse Episode\u201d takes place any number of life or case damaging phenomena can occur. </p> <p>Therefore it is vital that the processor is well aware of what processing action to do and when to do that action. </p> <p>It is not enough just to handle the \u201cAbuse Episode\u201d you must also restore all 29 levels of operation, all the way back to a fully recovered \u201cOwn Universe Ascension State.\u201d </p> <p>AS THE BEING TRANSENDS EACH STEP UPWARD, THERE IS A FURTHER REGAINING AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE BEING\u2019S POWER, STRENGTH, CLEVERNESS, SKILL AND ABILITY.</p> <p>THE 29 VITAL UPWARD STEPS OF TIME AND LIFE SEQUENCES LEADING THROUGH THE HANDLING OF THE ABUSE EPISODE PHENOMENA AND ABOVE</p> <p>The most extreme level is denial, doesn\u2019t know they do not know, they are so overwhelmed and in such pain that they cannot even face up to the fact something is very wrong in an area. </p> <p>The most common way a being handles denial is to engage in the tacit sabotage action of burying themselves amongst those who are playing the same game of being into the same denials. \u201cBirds of a feather flocking together\u201d phenomena. </p> <p>For a client to want to get something handled, they must have something they know they really want to get handled. </p> <p>Therefore the first step is profiling the client. This will bring to view the following: </p> <ol> <li>AN EXTREME BAD CONDITION OR LOW LEVEL OF EXISTENCE. </li> </ol> <p>This is a low Red Zone level of existence. It includes poverty, bankruptcy, depression, personal dishonesty, no self worth, low self esteem, broken-hearts, immobility, terror, failure, etc., etc. </p> <p>Behind this sits the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>AN AREA OF BLACKNESS. (Red Zone, level of existence Absence.) Contains heavy areas of fear of pain, abuse, dishonesty, false answers and terror of being wrong or being made wrong. </p> </li> <li> <p>AN AREA OF STUPIDITY. (Red Zone, level of existence Chaos.) Contains heavy areas of abusive false and wrong answers that are locked in painful abusive episodes of teaching, training or educational life incidents. </p> </li> </ol> <p>These false or wrong answers have been forced to be believed due to the threat of punishment or abuse if you \u201cdo not know what you are studying\u201d by Abusive authorities, teachers or parents. </p> <ol> <li> <p>AN AREA OF CONFUSION. (Red Zone, level of existence Chaos.) Contains recognition of abusive dishonesties of self and others, plus recognition of areas of having engaged in producing abusive wrongnesses, falseness and betrayals of trust, without knowing how to correct and atone for the abusiveness and the damage created by that abuse. </p> </li> <li> <p>STUCK IN A SHOCK. (Red Zone, level of existence Absence.) Areas of shock and the technology of handling, are covered in earlier bulletins and tapes. </p> </li> <li> <p>STUCK IN A HUGE UPSET. (Red Zone, all levels.) An upset comes in many forms, but an upset is primarily a form of \u201celectronic spiritual explosion or implosion.\u201d As an explosion, it disintegrates the being and its creations, driving the being out and away from the area they are occupying. (The being cannot get back into the area.) </p> </li> </ol> <p>As an implosion, the being and its creations disintegrate and the area collapses over the being and buries it under the rubble of its former creations. (The being is completely disintegrated, trapped and submerged in the area.) </p> <ol> <li> <p>OPERATING ON A HUGE NEGATIVE PROGRAM. (Red Zone, all levels.) The being has decided that people and life are evil and bad. All education is perverted into a negative experience. The being superimposes negative precepts and pictures over people, places, subjects and things. </p> </li> <li> <p>HAS EVERYONE AS THEIR ENEMY. (Psychic warfare, Red Zone, all levels.) In this state people are not interested in truth or effectiveness, they are dedicated to finding someone to blame for their condition or level of existence. </p> </li> </ol> <p>It is from this point upward, from 8 to 1, that your client is constantly in the Red Zone. They are being created as a chronic losing negative identity constantly getting and giving UNWANTED WANTS. </p> <ol> <li> <p>IS BURIED IN PAIN AND UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS. (Low Yellow and Red Zone, all levels.) Fear is the predominant emotion and attitude of this state of being. This shows up as an immobilizing, overwhelming fear of success, prosperity, work, winning, cold calling, prospecting, leadership and people handling reluctances. </p> </li> <li> <p>AN ABUSIVE EPISODE. (You were given what you did not want, or something happened you did not want, producing \u201can Alien UNWANTED WANT or OBJECT.\u201d Red Zone, all levels.) </p> </li> </ol> <p>At this point life begins to become a grim ordeal and is filled with tedium, your client begins to lose big time at the games of life. </p> <ol> <li>KARMIC TELEPATHIC SELECTION OF AN ABUSER OR GANG OF ABUSERS TO PUNISH THEMSELVES. (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.) </li> </ol> <p>By instigating self-determined changes, the being is compulsively attracted to AN ABUSER or ABUSIVE situation. </p> <p>This is the point the being gives up control of their own universe and goes on someone else\u2019s time trail, someone else\u2019s space, someone else\u2019s energy or money, someone else\u2019s objects. </p> <p>The being has failed at being ethical, and believes they do not deserve to own their \u201cown universe.\u201d The only answer is to give up control and be punished by An Abuser for failing and betrayal. </p> <p>This is how the law of KARMA comes into being. </p> <p>The law of KARMA is the universal spiritual ETHICS and JUSTICE self- enforced and self-disciplined, SYSTEM of PRINCIPLES having been created and AGREED UPON by and for spiritual beings to be able to maintain an HONOR based ETHICS and JUSTICE SYSTEM. </p> <p>This spiritual ETHICS and JUSTICE SYSTEM demands that you, the being, will utilize your psychic powers to fully penalize or punish yourself when you have violated your own Basic Goodness, Codes, Principles, Virtues and Integrity. </p> <p>Or: </p> <p>You will fully utilize your psychic powers to fully reward and enhance yourself when you have honored your Basic Goodness, Honesty, Codes, Principles, Virtues and Integrity. </p> <ol> <li>THE FURIES, PERSONAL TURMOIL, PANIC AND CONFUSION. (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.) </li> </ol> <p>The being is devastated and furious at itself for having violated their Codes, Virtues, Principles and Integrity. </p> <p>The being has enormous feelings of guilt, fear of being found out, worry, ervousness, loss of self respect, lack of self worth and betrayal. </p> <p>By committing harmful acts and having secrets from those who have trusted the client, the client realizes they have betrayed the trust of their friends, partners and family. </p> <p>The being is desperate to solve and escape from these turmoils, guilts and feelings of having betrayed those who have trusted or loved them. </p> <p>To solve and handle their furies, conflicts, turmoil, guilt, etc., the being decides to do something to stop themselves from violating their Codes, Virtues, Principles, and Integrity by creating self-determined changes in their life. </p> <p>Such self-determined changes as: </p> <ul> <li> <p>To go on a diet. </p> </li> <li> <p>To change jobs. </p> </li> <li> <p>To end a relationship. </p> </li> <li> <p>To get married. </p> </li> <li> <p>To get divorced. </p> </li> <li> <p>To join a religious group. </p> </li> <li> <p>To become a nun. </p> </li> <li> <p>To sell. </p> </li> <li> <p>To buy. </p> </li> <li> <p>To invest. </p> </li> <li> <p>To go bankrupt. </p> </li> <li> <p>To move to another country. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Etc., Etc. </p> <p>All self determined changes are preceded by the furies, turmoil, confusion, senses of guilt, feelings of betrayal, violations of trusts. </p> <ol> <li> <p>KEPT HIDDEN THEIR HARMFUL ACTS. (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.) </p> </li> <li> <p>FAILURE, INCOMPETENCE, PRODUCING HARMFUL OR NO PRODUCTS, NO WANTS. (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.) </p> </li> <li> <p>COMMITS HARMFUL ACTS THAT VIOLATE THEIR CODES, PRINCIPLES AND INTEGRITY. (Yellow or Red Zone levels of existence.) </p> </li> <li> <p>PRETENSE, PRETENDING TO KNOW. (Yellow or Red Zone.) </p> </li> </ol> <p>It is from this point, 17 backwards to 1, that will cause your client to begin to fail at the games of life. </p> <ol> <li>COLLIDES WITH AREAS OF NON-COMPREHENSION, LACK OF TRUTH, KNOWLEDGE, TECHNOLOGY, SKILL OR ABILITY. (Yellow Zone.) </li> </ol> <p>This is the most vital point in TIME and SPACE. It is where your client can either succeed or fail. </p> <p>Your client\u2019s future PROSPERITY, SUCCESS and HAPPINESS, depends entirely on whether they are fully ROLE EDUCATED on THE TECHNOLOGY of HOW to ATTAIN and MAINTAIN PROSPERITY, SUCCESS and HAPPINESS. </p> <p>Over the forty years in this field, spanning an excess of 500,000 people, the most omitted training step on all people is: How to Attain and Handle PROSPERITY. </p> <p>If a client or student has been disintegrated by an ABUSER and has been created as a loser or failure, it does not matter how well you educate, train or process them, they will end up involuntarily, compulsively creating a losing and failing life situation, on the edge of, or deeply in POVERTY AND SADNESS. </p> <ol> <li> <p>LIFE GOING FAIRLY WELL, OCCASIONAL ATTAINMENT OF WANTS. (Low Green or Yellow Zone levels of existence.) </p> </li> <li> <p>LIFE GOING GREAT, CONSISTENT ATTAINMENT OF YOUR CLIENT\u2019S AND OTHERS\u2019 WANTS. (High Green Zone levels of existence.) </p> </li> <li> <p>IN ACTION, IN THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, FOLLOWING THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGED MASTER PLAN. (High Green Zone.) </p> </li> <li> <p>CREATES A MASTERFUL WINNING IDENTITY. (High Green Zone.) </p> </li> <li> <p>CREATES A FULL HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGED MASTER PLAN. (High Green Zone.) </p> </li> <li> <p>CHOOSES CLEVERLY, IN ALIGNMENT WITH THEIR CODES, TO SPIRITUALLY PLAY THE EXACT RIGHT SPIRITUAL GAME TO PRODUCE WHAT IS REALLY WANTED. (High Green Zone.) </p> </li> <li> <p>KNOW WITH FULL HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGERY WHAT THEY AND OTHERS REALLY WANT. (High Green Zone.) </p> </li> <li> <p>HAS A HUGE HOLOGRAPHIC DREAM THAT MASSIVELY DOES THE GREATEST GOOD FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER, ABUNDANTLY GIVING AND PRODUCING WHAT ARE THE TRUE HOLOGRAPHIC WANTS. (High Green Zone.) </p> </li> </ol> <p>The being\u2019s dreams, intentions, goals or purposes act as the being\u2019s WILL POWER, and are the most basic power source and directional focus of spiritual forces and psychic powers of the Spiritual Being in order to fully attain the HOLOGRAPHIC WANTS. </p> <ol> <li>HOLOGRAPHICALLY CREATED WANT. (Gold Zone.) </li> </ol> <p>The holographic WANT stems from the truth, knowledge and love obtained as a result of having applied full spiritual permeation into what needs to be accurately perceived in an optimum or non-optimum area. </p> <p>This area has been holographically permeated and perceived in its entirety of its energy, matter, space, time, mood, form, condition, level of existence, its operating responsibilities and consequences. </p> <p>The WANT is what is needed to upgrade or destroy the non-optimum area. </p> <p>The WANT creates the desire, drive and intention to have a game. </p> <p>Anything that impedes, slows, misdirects, prevents or stops the attainment of the wants, dreams, intentions, goals or purposes of the Spiritual Being robs the being of power, direction and focus, thus robbing the being of its chances of fully attaining those wants, dreams, intentions, goals or purposes. </p> <p>Rehabilitation of a Spiritual Being\u2019s wants, dreams, intentions, goals and purposes are the MOST VITAL PROCESSING ACTIONS you can implement towards fully handling the being\u2019s case, plus restoring the being\u2019s Codes, Virtues, Principles and Integrity. </p> <ol> <li>AN OPTIMUM OR NON-OPTIMUM AREA, SUBJECT, THING, OBJECT, PLACE OR PERSON THAT NEEDS TO BE SPIRITUALY FULLY PERMEATED AND PERCEIVED. (All Zones.) </li> </ol> <p>All WANTS are discovered and holographically created at this step. </p> <ol> <li> <p>HAS THE ABILITY TO FULLY PERMEATE, PERCEIVE, CREATE AND OPERATE CORRECTLY, ACCURATELY AND EFFECTIVELY IN A HIGH STABLE ASCENDED SPIRITUAL STATE.

This creates new point B\u2019s.</p> <p>A Being stuck in MASS tends to dramatize what is not in the MASS.</p> <p>A Spiritual or Mental MASS has an absence or compression of time, space and energy, further the being withdraws as many life force particles as possible out of the MASS, consequently this leaves the MASS to contain practically no life force particles and it feels lifeless. A strong feeling of deathfulness will emanate from someone who is buried in unhandled MASSES.</p> <p>The Being in a physical universe life tends to dramatize the Noes:</p> <p>No time.</p> <p>No interest.</p> <p>No space.</p> <p>No reach.</p> <p>No energy. (Money.)</p> <p>What makes this more deadly is the Being is obsessively attracted to others who are stuck in similar MASSES.</p> <p>Thus you get a Tacit Sabotage situation of mutually agreed-upon the above Noes.</p> <p>Poverty is a mutually agreed upon dramatization of: The above Noes.</p> <p>When you handle and vanish Spiritual MASS and Mental MASS you handle the solidified areas of charge, the Being naturally comes back to life, begins to move up the scales and Zones.</p> <p>The more powerful the Being becomes the larger the MASSES are that the being is willing to handle.</p> <p>These monster MASSES can contain the full spectrum of the mood scale from the top of the Gold Zone to the bottom of the Red Zone.</p> <p>To vanish a Spiritual MASS or Mental MASS requires handling the \u201cunwilling to experience moods and e-motions.\u201d</p> <p>The simple questions:</p> <p>Is there a mood you are unwilling to experience? (This question brings up both emotions and attitudes.)</p> <p>Tell me about it? </p> <p>Will unlock most MASSES.</p> <p>Too much MASS in present time will cause a being to be unwilling to holographically permeate lifes actualities. Consequently the being will tend to create unreal futures. Or worse avoid present time.</p> <p>Failure to deliver what you promised will build up huge quantities of MASS, making the NOW TIME and PLACE unlivable. This causes the being to want to escape into the past time and place or into a future time and place.</p> <p>OT is simply an Operating Spiritual Being. </p> <p>That is a Spiritual Being knowingly being, doing and having spiritually what they are being, doing and having spiritually.</p> <p>At  times they are at cause \u2014 at times they are effect.</p> <p>Clearing has to do with the mind and is very similar to debugging a computer.</p> <p>The you have Spiritual Clearing. This has to do with creations of harmony or disharmony of the beings mock-ups.</p> <p>A Spiritual Being who has unknowns in an area will create their mock-ups with those unknowns in them.</p> <p>Spiritual Being processing is very different from mind processing. The major difference being Spiritual Being processing  is outside of time and space. And is of a vertical nature.</p> <p>Where-as mind processing is very linear and is contained within time and space. It is similar to handling a computer.</p> <p>Mental Image Pictures are the minds icons. Have the Being click on a MIP and you will get the whole program if you keep clicking. By clicking I mean accessing.</p> <p>As Spiritual Beings tend to operate outside time and space most of their creations span many physical body lifetimes.</p> <p>That there are OT\u2019s is self evident, to those who can duplicate and have their holographic mock-ups and span their time lines.</p> <p>Though most OT\u2019s usually concentrate on specific areas of knowledge and effectiveness.</p> <p>Clearings also has to do with specific areas. You can be clear in many areas and unclear in many other areas.</p> <p>There are agreed-upon outside mechanisms that keep civilizations on track.</p> <p>What is also self evident is there is a vast area to be studied, mastered and coordinated with.</p> <p>Alan</p> <p>Homer Wilson Smith   Clear Air, Clear Water,  Art Matrix - Lightlink</p> <p>(607) 277-0959  A Green Earth and Peace.

Something about the session or the  session environment matches a past incident or PTP\u2019s of long duration.

I felt weird that strange sinking feeling again.\u201d </p> <p>Still no reads on the meter. But some pc attention and interest. </p> <p>You cannot pull out a List Correction as the meter doesn\u2019t read and the pc has probably been butchered with correction lists in  the past. </p> <p>So you do simple incident running on Listing and finding items. </p> <p>When did you first run into trouble to do with missed items? </p> <p>If it is the correct area the pc will be able to run that track, occasionally the meter will begin to read, but it will be very latent. </p> <p>As the Item finding disasters unfold, the meter will read more, but more likely the List outnesses are sitting on top of other  session by-passed charge. Or the pc says....Christ the missed item is AN AUDITOR. At which point the pc will begin to  unleash a barrage of hatred at Auditors. Then suddenly realize his dad is a psych and he represented auditors and auditing.  Yadda - yadda! </p> <p>You find the father broke every part of the auditors code, butchered the comm cycle, chopped the itsa-maker line, and so did  all the other therapists and so has the pc. </p> <p>It can take weeks or even years to undo. You take every session item the pc has some response to. If it is not charged, the pc  will look at it and happily tell you not charged. </p> <p>But undo it will. </p> <p>The meter will begin to read more. </p> <p>Meanwhile the pc\u2019s life and living will begin to improve. </p> <p>Surely one should not run every non reading item!</p> <p>No, definitely not, but you can feel pc interest or fixated attention in the correct area.

The handling and permeating of the force, charge and masses contacted that are contained or attached to the present time self, others and environment phase</p> <p>Phase 11. The expanded present time phase.</p> <p>Phase 12. The webbing phase. This is the creating of three-dimensional holographic future images and telepathic projection of those images to cause fusion with others\u2019 images who want to create similar optimum scenarios.</p> <p>Phase 13. The continuation of the process as a three-dimensional holographic action in a real three-dimensional holographic expanded present time phase.</p> <p>Phase 14. The upscaling of lines, terminals and games of life phase.</p> <p>Phase 15. The continuous attainments of optimum wants phase.</p> <p>Phase 16. The living of your life with a continuous floating tone arm and full Green Zone Truth Phenomena phase.</p> <p>Phase 1.   The selected process introduction phase:</p> <p>This phase is possibly the most crucial of all the phases as it sets the client up to be willing to run the chosen process.</p> <p>The processor states: What we are going to run is\u2026(chosen process or subject to be addressed).</p> <p>The processor should be very aware of the client\u2019s indicators at that moment.</p> <p>Often if it is the exact right process, the client will immediately go in session and start running the process and what your statement triggered. If this happens, put in the communication cycle and handle what got triggered.</p> <p>Usually clients are intensely curious as to why you chose that particular process or set of processes to run on them.</p> <p>A vital part of processing is maintaining two-way communication with the client.</p> <p>Intense curiosity means there is a high level of attention available for communicating.</p> <p>I find it very advantageous to have a small pack of bulletins to give to the client to study that outlines the chosen process.  The reason for this is it orients, familiarizes and gives the client many more viewpoints from which to view the area or subject and process chosen.</p> <p>The most basic reason people have trouble in an area or subject is that they are \u201csubject illiterate\u201d in the area or subject.  This \u201csubject illiteracy\u201d prevents the client from being able to occupy a positive position or create stable viewpoints from which to view the area or subject. Further, it prevents the client from being role educated in the area or subject.  This sequence causes the client to be a walking, talking, in destructive action, disaster, chaos producing, unknowing saboteur in the area or subject.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>The processor states:  \u201cThe area and processes we are going to inspect and run in this session have to do with  help!\u2019</p> <p>Immediately the client plunges down scale.</p> <p>The introduction has triggered the client instantly into an area of charge.</p> <p>At that moment you had better handle what got accessed.</p> <p>A simple:  \u201cWhat did you think of when I mentioned help?\u201d</p> <p>The client:  \u201cChrist, talk about help! I had to fire my long time bookkeeper, she had been embezzling funds from my company for 15 years. She was one of my most trusted employees\u201d.</p> <p>Client pauses,  \u201cthen there is my goddamn girlfriend I loaned her my car yesterday and she wrecked it.\u201d  Another pause, \u201d and my kids who I have given everything to are just a bunch of drugged out zombies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen there was this other group I was in, they really screwed me up with their weird processes and ideas, cost me $150,000 and 15 years of my life.\u201d</p> <p>This client is into BLAME.  Help has so much charge and by-passed-charge on it you need to handle the upsets, problems, harmful acts and failed solutions connected to the subject.</p> <p>If done correctly, the client will be fascinated as well as excited to find out all they can about the chosen process and its subject.</p> <p>As you discharge the red zone areas on the subject of help you can introduce the next phase.</p> <p>Phase 2.   The definition of the subject to be processed phase.</p> <p>You simply ask the client: </p> <p>\u201cWhat is your definition of the subject help?\u201d</p> <p>Or: </p> <p>\u201cWhat does the word help mean to you?\u201d </p> <p>You might be surprised at the client\u2019s answers. </p> <p>Client: </p> <p>\u201cHelp means do what I tell you to do!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp means I pay you, I own you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp means I\u2019m in control!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp means get it done now!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp means make it go right!\u201d</p> <p>Or you may get computations:</p> <p>\u201d   You can\u2019t get help these days!\u201d</p> <p>\u201d   If someone helps you, be careful they are definitely no good!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you ask for help you ask for trouble!\u201d</p> <p>You repeat the question: </p> <p>\u201cWhat does the word help mean to you?\u201d </p> <p>The client: \u201cTrouble.\u201d smiling.</p> <p>At this point you pull out the dictionary or bulletin that has the definition of help.</p> <p>Help:  verb. Pronunciation: \u2018help; Southern often \u2018hep also \u2018he&amp;p [Middle English, from Old English helpan; akin to Old High German helfan to help.] Date: before 12<sup>th</sup> century transitive senses 1.  to give assistance or support to (help a child with homework), 2a.  to make more pleasant or bearable : IMPROVE, RELIEVE (bright curtains will help the room), (took an aspirin to help her headache),  b.  archaic : RESCUE, SAVE, 3a.   to be of use to,  BENEFIT,   b.  to further the advancement of, PROMOTE, 4a.  to change for the better,  b. to refrain from, AVOID,  c.  to keep from occurring, PREVENT (they couldn\u2019t help the accident,)  d.  to restrain (oneself) from doing something, (knew they shouldn\u2019t go but couldn\u2019t help themselves). 1.  give assistance or support \u2014 often used with out,  2 . to be of use or benefit. Synonym see IMPROVE</p> <p>As the client reads the above definition he will go through many mood shifts,  often chuckling to himself and shaking his head.</p> <p>As you can observe, there are many positive words and subjects connected to help.</p> <p>On a process as important as help, I would Clean Slate each of the positive words and finally Clean Slate HELP.</p> <p>The end product of Clean Slating the power words and HELP is a full three-dimensional holographic concept of HELP.  This will produce a floating tone arm and floating needle on the three-dimensional holographic concept only.</p> <p>Phase 3.   The beginning of running the process phase.</p> <p>You state the first process command:</p> <p>\u201cWhat does the command:  \u2018How could someone or something help you?\u2019 Slight pause; mean?\u201d</p> <p>Client: \u201cIt means how could a person or thing aid, assist or make me better able to get what I want to achieve out of life or out of my dreams.\u201d</p> <p>You do the same on all commands.</p> <p>Phase 4.   The sorting out phase.</p> <p>You ask the first command:</p> <p>The client often goes through a period of confusion as he selects his whos, things and on what he would like to get help.</p> <p>As he sorts out the flows and chooses the whos, things and what he would like to get help on and with he moves to the next phase of the process.</p> <p>This phase often produces a floating needle.</p> <p>Phase 5.   The significance to self phase.</p> <p>Most clients are only interested in themselves and what others can do for them at this phase.</p> <p>Again this phase can produce a floating needle.</p> <p>Others are not really real to them.</p> <p>Slowly they move into the next phase.</p> <p>Phase 6.   The significance to self mocked-up others phase.</p> <p>This is a stripping of false ideas and mock-ups of and about others help phase.</p> <p>The client is in their own universe running their false ideas and mock-ups of help on who they have labeled and placed their ideas and mock-ups on. It appears as if they are running actual people and things but in actuality, they are in a self fulfilling box of incorrect apparencies.</p> <p>The client has never really communicated to anyone.  They communicated to their false ideas and labeled mock-ups they thought others were.</p> <p>As these strip away many floating needles will be observed.</p> <p>As the people and things begin to get truer, the client collides with the next phase.</p> <p>This is a very good point to go back and review the key words connected to the process. By doing this the client will have greater certainty on their position in regards the subject or area.</p> <p>Phase 7.   The collision into force, charge and mass contained in the client\u2019s mock-ups of self, others and environment phase.</p> <p>As the client runs the process, they begin to connect to the true persons or things.  This triggers the old charge, upsets, force, pain, and mass that caused them to put substitute ideas, mock-ups and labels on people, places, subjects and things.</p> <p>Usually the resistance value begins to move quite heavily at this phase. Lots of heavy incidents and conflicts with others and things blow to view and erase.</p> <p>Often the client begins to realize how he failed to help others and how others were prevented from helping him.</p> <p>Lots of floating resistance values and floating needle phenomena on people, places, subjects and things.</p> <p>An Ascension Experience has occurred.</p> <p>In most cases most processes are ended at this point. But this is the most dangerous point to end a process as you have only achieved A STATE OF DETACHMENT.</p> <p>The STATE OF DETACHMENT is in actuality a state of spiritual death.</p> <p>A common by-product at this point is a massive high followed by heavy depression,. leaving the client stuck in depression. This is end of game phenomena.  But the game was not truly ended.  This also sticks the client with considerable amount of unfinished games.</p> <p>What has occurred is the client has erased their substitution of a false actuality with the solid present time actuality.  They have arrived in true present time.</p> <p>If a client is stopped in their processing at this point, too often the client will experience enforced separation from the composite that is their present time operating mock-up.</p> <p>A similar thing occurs when people take psychedelic drugs.</p> <p>The client will have tremendous difficulty in being able to get in and play the games of life.</p> <p>You end up with a kind of brilliant philosopher who has the answer for everything yet their present time is an operating disaster. Constant chronic financial and relationship difficulties repeatedly re-occur.</p> <p>In the old days the processes were run much deeper.</p> <p>Which would put us in this next phase.</p> <p>Phase 8.   The three-dimensional holographic phase.</p> <p>As the Being makes connection to the true actual other Beings, people, places, subjects and things, the Being begins to connect and three-dimensional holographic creations begin to appear and a Spiritual interaction takes place.</p> <p>Wide floating tone arm.</p> <p>A feeling of being able to move in or out of any position and a willingness to occupy any position at will.</p> <p>Phase 9.   The actual contact by telepathic projection with present time self, others and environment phase.</p> <p>As the process is continued the client will become very big (exterior) and go into excellent telepathic interaction and permeation with their chosen people, places, subjects and things.  The client will begin to telepathically help and be helped by their chosen people, places, subjects and things.</p> <p>Phase 10. The handling and permeating of the force, charge and masses contacted that are contained or attached to the present time self, others, people, places, subjects and things and environment phase.</p> <p>As the Being occupies his present time environment and includes and takes willing ownership for all the people, places, subjects, things and environment the charge, force and mass that is on the subject of help towards people, places, subjects, things and environment in present time begins to be permeated, discharged and erased.</p> <p>The Being\u2019s holographically envisioned imagery creation begins to be telepathically projected to fuse with others who have similarly holographically envisioned imagery creations and these, due to the fusion, become agreed-upon.</p> <p>Big floating tone arm state.</p> <p>Phase 11. The expanded present time phase.</p> <p>At this level the client is very much in an expanded present time state which includes long time futures.</p> <p>The Being can be both above and outside as well as inside the complete creation and all its parts.  The Being has no difficulties being in or out of the creations or in or out of the connections to people, places, subjects and things. The game and help is now fun and exciting.</p> <p>Phase 12. The webbing phase.  This is the creating of three-dimensional holographic future images and telepathic projection of those images to cause fusion with others\u2019 images that want to create similar optimum scenarios.  Also included are the lines, terminals and relay points. </p> <p>As more and more charge, force, and mass is permeated, more and more beings join in and play and contribute help  In the Spiritual Universe, the lines, terminals and relay points appear as a vast silvery similar to a spiders web of thin telepathic lines crisscrossing vast distances.</p> <p>Phase 13. The continuation of the process as a three-dimensional holographic action in a real three-dimensional holographicly expanded present time phase.</p> <p>This process of permeation and telepathic projected fusion of imagery connects more and more players.  The game becomes  bigger and the help is more effective..</p> <p>Phase 14.

This is the action of someone or something causing slows or stops to your prime intention.</p> <p>The abrasive friction can get more intense by someone or something using counter-force, disruptive imagery, or rubbing or being in conflict against someone or something.</p> <p>Where you have abrasive friction you have a slow buildup of an accumulation of unwanted charge and pain.  It can take years for the accumulation of unwanted charge to build up to a level of pain that produces a wanting or need to avoid the area.</p> <p>Abrasive friction-caused unwanted charge and the subsequent pain is caused by a subtle, gradual accumulation of unwanted charge until it becomes pain and becomes unbearable, at which point you are forced to be absent or leave the area.</p> <p>2)  IMPACT.  This is the sudden forceful collision with someone or something that is stronger or more powerful than you.  Such impacts cause immense unwanted charge, pain, shocks and collapse universes.</p> <p>When you are impacted suddenly, an area of unwanted charge and pain is created.  That unwanted charge and pain can be so severe that it can ruin your life.</p> <p>Death of someone you love, the loss of a game, the loss of a partner, a car crash, being fired, failing an exam, an explosion, constant abuse, etc., etc., all cause overwhelming unwanted negative charge and pain.</p> <p>That unwanted negative charge and pain can be impacted in the body, the identity, the mind, or you, the spirit.  The most savage unwanted negative charge and pain are impacted instantly in all four areas simultaneously.</p> <p>To fully erase this charge and pain requires several different techniques.  All are easy to do, but require bravery, time, money, and the commitment and intention to handle fully the source of the unwanted charge and pain.</p> <p>These are some of the subsequent consequences caused by friction:</p> <p>3)  Heat caused by contact, abrasive friction, or impact.  Too much heat causes unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>4)  Cold, which is caused by a vacuum, distance, enforced separation or low temperature.  Too much cold causes unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>5)  Polarity conflict that is generated by the rapid changing of particles backward and forward from positive to negative polarity in a repeated, violent manner, causing unpleasant sensations.</p> <p>6)  Electricity that is generated by the differing wavelengths of life-force particles impacting or dispersing from an area.  Too much electrical randomness can be extremely uncomfortable.</p> <p>7)  Magnetism.  The constant compulsive or obsessive attraction or repelling of life-force particles and holographic spiritual and mental imagery into or away from a specific area of abrasive friction or impact.  Too much inward pulling causes sensations of entrapment; too much dispersal causes unpleasant sensations of scatteredness or dispersal; the desperation of attempting to get in and connect but cannot.  Either way, your ability to concentrate or focus your attention and have your intentions and vision manifest themselves in the exact place and time you want is greatly diminished.</p> <p>8)  Trapped life-force particles.

Wattles</p> <p>CHAPTER 11</p> <p>Acting in the Certain Way</p> <p>THOUGHT is the creative power, or the impelling force which causes the creative power to act; thinking in a Certain Way will bring riches to you, but you must not rely upon thought alone, paying no attention to personal action.  That is the rock upon which many otherwise scientific metaphysical thinkers meet shipwreck\u2013the failure to connect thought with personal action.</p> <p>We have not yet reached the stage of development, even supposing such a stage to be possible, in which man can create directly from Formless Substance without nature\u2019s processes or the work of human hands; man must not only think, but his personal action must supplement his thought.</p> <p>By thought you can cause the gold in the hearts of the mountains to be impelled toward you; but it will not mine itself, refine itself, coin itself into double eagles, and come rolling along the roads seeking its way into your pocket.</p> <p>Under the impelling power of the Supreme Spirit, men\u2019s affairs will be so ordered that some one will be led to mine the gold for you; other men\u2019s business transactions will be so directed that the gold will be brought toward you, and you must so arrange your own business affairs that you may be able to receive it when it comes to you.</p> <p>Your thought makes all things, animate and inanimate, work to bring you what you want; but your personal activity must be such that you can rightly receive what you want when it reaches you.</p> <p>You are not to take it as charity, nor to steal it; you must give every man more in use value than he gives you in cash value.</p> <p>The scientific use of thought consists in forming a clear and distinct mental image of what you want; in holding fast to the purpose to get what you want; and in realizing with grateful faith that you do get what you want.</p> <p>Do not try to \u2018project\u2019 your thought in any mysterious or occult way, with the idea of having it go out and do things for you; that is wasted effort, and will weaken your power to think with sanity.</p> <p>The action of thought in getting rich is fully explained in the preceding chapters; your faith and purpose positively impress your vision upon Formless Substance, which has THE SAME DESIRE FOR MORE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE; and this vision, received from you, sets all the creative forces at work IN AND THROUGH THEIR REGULAR CHANNELS OF ACTION, but directed toward you.</p> <p>It is not your part to guide or supervise the creative process; all you have to do with that is to retain your vision, stick to your purpose, and maintain your faith and gratitude.</p> <p>But you must act in a Certain Way, so that you can appropriate what is yours when it comes to you; so that you can meet the things you have in your picture, and put them in their proper places as they arrive.</p> <p>You can really see the truth of this.  When things reach you, they will be in the hands of other men, who will ask an equivalent for them.</p> <p>And you can only get what is yours by giving the other man what is his.</p> <p>Your pocketbook is not going to be transformed into a Fortunata\u2019s purse, which shall be always full of money without effort on your part.</p> <p>This is the crucial point in the science of getting rich; right here, where thought and personal action must be combined.</p> <p>There are very many people who, consciously or unconsciously, set the creative forces in action by the strength and persistence of their desires, but who remain poor because they do not provide for the reception of the thing they want when it comes.</p> <p>By thought, the thing you want is brought to you; by action you receive it.</p> <p>Whatever your action is to be, it is evident that you must act NOW.</p> <p>You cannot act in the past, and it is essential to the clearness of your mental vision that you dismiss the past from your mind.</p> <p>You cannot act in the future, for the future is not here yet. And you cannot tell how you will want to act in any future contingency until that contingency has arrived.</p> <p>Because you are not in the right business, or the right environment now, do not think that you must postpone action until you get into the right business or environment.  And do not spend time in the present taking thought as to the best course in possible future emergencies; have faith in your ability to meet any emergency when it arrives.</p> <p>If you act in the present with your mind on the future, your present action will be with a divided mind, and will not be effective.</p> <p>Put your whole mind into present action.</p> <p>Do not give your creative impulse to Original Substance, and then sit down and wait for results; if you do, you will never get them.</p> <p>Act now.</p> <p>There is never any time but now, and there never will be any time but now.  If you are ever to begin to make ready for the reception of what you want, you must begin now.</p> <p>And your action, whatever it is, must most likely be in your present business or employment, and must be upon the persons and things in your present environment.</p> <p>You cannot act where you are not; you cannot act where you have been, and you cannot act where you are going to be; you can act only where you are.</p> <p>Do not bother as to whether yesterday\u2019s work was well done or ill done; do to-day\u2019s work well.</p> <p>Do not try to do tomorrow\u2019s work now; there will be plenty of time to do that when you get to it.</p> <p>Do not try, by occult or mystical means, to act on people or things that are out of your reach.</p> <p>Do not wait for a change of environment, before you act; get a change of environment by action.</p> <p>You can so act upon the environment in which you are now, as to cause yourself to be transferred to a better environment.</p> <p>Hold with faith and purpose the vision of yourself in the better environment, but act upon your present environment with all your heart, and with all your strength, and with all your mind.</p> <p>Do not spend any time in day dreaming or castle building; hold to the one vision of what you want, and act NOW.</p> <p>Do not cast about seeking some new thing to do, or some strange, unusual, or remarkable action to perform as a first step toward getting rich.</p> <p>It is probable that your actions, at least for some time to come, will be those you have been performing for some time past; but you are to begin now to perform these actions in the Certain Way, which will surely make you rich.</p> <p>If you are engaged in some business, and feel that it is not the right one for you, do not wait until you get into the right business before you begin to act.</p> <p>Do not feel discouraged, or sit down and lament because you are misplaced.  No man was ever so misplaced but that he could not find the right place, and no man ever became so involved in the wrong business but that he could get into the right business.</p> <p>Hold the vision of yourself in the right business, with the purpose to get into it, and the faith that you will get into it, and are getting into it; but ACT in your present business.</p> <p>Use your present business as the means of getting a better one, and use your present environment as the means of getting into a better one.</p> <p>Your vision of the right business, if held with faith and purpose, will cause the Supreme to move the right business toward you; and your action, if performed in the Certain Way, will cause you to move toward the business.</p> <p>If you are an employee, or wage earner, and feel that you must change places in order to get what you want, do not \u2018project\u201d your thought into space and rely upon it to get you another job.  It will probably fail to do so.</p> <p>Hold the vision of yourself in the job you want, while you ACT with faith and purpose on the job you have, and you will certainly get the job you want.</p> <p>Your vision and faith will set the creative force in motion to bring it toward you, and your action will cause the forces in your own environment to move you toward the place you want.  In closing this chapter, we will add another statement to our syllabus:\u2013</p> <p>There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made, and which, in its original state, permeates, penetrates, and fills the interspaces of the universe.</p> <p>A thought, in this substance, Produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.</p> <p>Man can form things in his thought, and, by impressing his thought upon formless substance, can cause the thing he thinks about to be created.</p> <p>In order to do this, man must pass from the competitive to the creative mind; he must form a clear mental picture of the things he wants, and hold this picture in his thoughts with the fixed PURPOSE to get what he wants, and the unwavering FAITH that he does get what he wants, closing his mind to all that may tend to shake his purpose, dim his vision, or quench his faith.</p> <p>That he may receive what he wants when it comes, man must act NOW upon the people and things in his present environment.</p> <p>Sent By: Advanced Coaching &amp; Leadership Center 1400 Camp Letoli Rd Saint Jo TX  76265\u201dBR\u201dU.S.A.</p> <p>To view as a web page press on or copy this link into your browsers address bar http://www.swiftpage1.com/ACLC.ACLC/C060313155100/SpeAsAPage.aspx?AddrE19</p> <p>If you prefer not to receive future e-mails of this type, please copy to your browser or press on this link</p> <p>\u201chttp://www.swiftpage1.com/SpeSupIt.aspx?&amp;Page\u00acLC.ACLC&amp;Cam\u00c060313155100&amp;Addrhomer~~2lightlink.com\u201d to unsubscribe.</p> <pre><code>============ http://www.clearing.org ============\nTue Mar 14 14:26:03 EST 2006\nftp://ftp.lightlink.com/pub/archive/homer/adore319.memo\nSend mail to archive@lightlink.com saying help\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.6.2\n\niQBVAwUBRBcYyz4RxM7qO/z1AQGsQAH9GeZyBMwECGDRDGo4C54FJSwv3QKhJguR\n27hMzYXEPRMeQj72XKeRRGZSh+M2S8ic38YWQBNG2XdX081dinlUVg\n=+izH\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n</code></pre> <p>Homer Wilson SmithThe Paths of Lovers    Art Matrix - Lightlink</p> <p>(607) 277-0959 KC2ITF   Cross  Internet Access, Ithaca NY</p> <p>homer@lightlink.com    In the Line of Duty    http://www.lightlink.com</p> <p>Thu Mar 16 16:21:38 EST 2006</p>"},{"location":"admonitions.html","title":"Alan C Walter alt.clearning postings archive","text":"<p>optional explicit title within double quotes</p> <p>Any number of other indented markdown elements.</p> <p>This is the second paragraph.</p> <p>Documentation at https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You should note that the title will be automatically capitalized.</p> <p>Don\u2019t try this at home</p> <p>you have been warned!</p> <p>Coming soon!</p> <ul> <li>use the left sidebar or hamburger menu \u2261 to select a topic</li> </ul> <p>or </p> <ul> <li>search for a term with \ud83d\udd0d </li> </ul> <p>Don\u2019t try this at home</p> <p>Last call</p> <ul> <li>use the left sidebar or hamburger menu \u2261 to select a topic</li> </ul> <p>or </p> <ul> <li>search for a term with \ud83d\udd0d </li> </ul>"},{"location":"ascension.html","title":"Ascension Experiences","text":"<p>Ascension Experiences are the most important phenomena to handle on a case.  </p> <p>An Ascension Experience is that time you felt huge.</p> <p>You have a massive presence.

Man\u2019s final frontier is Man himself.</p> <p>Psychologists and psychiatrists estimate we are using a scant one-to-five percent of our potential; that ninety-five to ninety-nine percent is hidden from us.  If this hidden potential is not working for us, then it may be working against us.  Can you imagine that ninety-five to ninety-nine percent of our power is being misdirected into restraining ourselves?</p> <p>Have you ever taken drugs or alcohol and felt the inhibitors and restraints dropping away?  Your personality flowed forth, you felt witty, you felt good, you felt alive, you felt powerful (it is these soaring feelings of wellness that lie behind addiction).  Yet when you sobered up or came off the drugs, you sank back into your cocoon of inhibitors and restraints.</p> <p>The drugs or alcohol acted to create a mild-to-strong ascension experience.</p> <p>The problem with drugs and alcohol is that they stimulate you, artificially, beyond your control.</p> <p>Ascension means to rise up.  An ascension experience is a period of time in which you rose to a higher state.</p> <p>Seminars, workshops, therapy, accidents, near-death experiences, violent trauma, a huge win, being \u2018born again,\u2019 the coming together of knowledge, an awareness of self as a spiritual being, etc.; all are phenomena that can cause a high.  That high is an ascension experience.</p> <p>Over the last thirty years there have been millions of people who attended transformational types of seminars; most business training contains some form of transformational technology.  Some of these have created enormous ascension experiences.</p> <p>The vast changes that are occurring globally at such an alarming rate that most of us are feeling disestablished, are the result of the cumulative effects of ascension experiences happening to millions of people.  The downfall of communism was a global ascension experience.</p> <p>An ascension experience causes the individual who experiences it to feel huge.  His awareness expands tremendously.  Often, he realizes he is just playing games and wearing disguises.  He realizes he is not his body; that his body is just a tool used to maintain his disguises.</p> <p>Frequently, one experiences the recovery of god-like abilities and perceptions.  The ascension experience has allowed one to unlock the immense powers hidden within.  Some individuals even realize they are giants, gods of their own universes.</p> <p>When this type of ascension experience manifests, life undergoes a tremendous change.  The ascension experience individual becomes a knowledge-seeking fanatic; he is on a steep learning curve.  What was once vitally important now seems ridiculous.  Often he finds himself getting promotion after promotion.  He may well end up running the whole show.</p> <p>But an ascension experience is a two-edged sword.  At the same time that positive powers are unleashed, so also are negative, destructive powers.  Often, to suppress and restrain the negative, destructive powers, the individual inhibits the positive ones.  Now he is back where he started.</p> <p>One of the greatest fears anyone has is that of being out of control.  Having control of your powers is vital to feeling in control of your universe.</p> <p>I have counseled a vast number of people over the last thirty-five years.  I have lost count of the number I have handled who experienced areas of life going out of control, having sexual promiscuity, drugs, alcohol, work, and financial problems.  All stemmed from having had a big ascension experience that unleashed all sorts of powers prior to the problem or obsession.</p> <p>The basic problem is that an ascension experience without knowledge and role education is somewhat like a runaway train: it may or may not arrive at its destination, but it is almost sure to cause some kind of destruction on its way.</p>"},{"location":"ascension.html#any-uncontrolled-ascension-experience-without-knowledge-and-role-education-and-with-unknown-misdirected-imagery-is-hazardous-to-your-future-success-prosperity-and-happiness","title":"ANY UNCONTROLLED ASCENSION EXPERIENCE, WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND ROLE EDUCATION, AND WITH UNKNOWN, MISDIRECTED IMAGERY, IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR FUTURE SUCCESS, PROSPERITY, AND HAPPINESS.","text":""},{"location":"ascension.html#a-controlled-ascension-experience-empowered-with-knowledge-role-education-and-known-projected-positive-imagery-is-essential-to-your-causing-and-having-future-success-prosperity-and-happiness","title":"A CONTROLLED ASCENSION EXPERIENCE, EMPOWERED WITH KNOWLEDGE, ROLE EDUCATION, AND KNOWN PROJECTED POSITIVE IMAGERY, IS ESSENTIAL TO YOUR CAUSING AND HAVING FUTURE SUCCESS, PROSPERITY, AND HAPPINESS.","text":""},{"location":"ascension.html#the-ascension-experience-deadly-phenomenon","title":"THE ASCENSION EXPERIENCE DEADLY PHENOMENON","text":"<p>An Ascension Experience throws you upward into one of your higher universes, which triggers automatic expellers and masking devices that can crash and put into chaos and shambles your existence in present time.</p> <p>An Ascension Experience is a deadly phenomenon without the proper role education and processing because you will have activated your most powerful psychic and telepathic abilities to work against you.</p> <p>The end product of the role education and processing is you fully being you with full control over your psychic and telepathic abilities, your ability to love restored fully, you owning and controlling your own universe, and you with the skills, knowledges and abilities to help others achieve their ascension states.</p> <p>Excerpted from the Books \u201cGODS IN DISGUISE and \u201cASCENSION EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS\u201d by Alan C.

Not performed willingly.  2.  Not subject to control.</p> <p>REPLICATION: n.  1.  A copy or reproduction.  2.  The act or process of duplicating or reproducing something.</p> <p>INVOLUNTARY REPLICATION: n.  The unwilling and out of control, automatic, three-dimensional, holographic reproduction of an event, identity, solution, or unwanted condition of some portion of a spiritual being\u2019s past being replicated recently, existing in the present, and continuing to exist in the future.</p> <p>By three-dimensional holograph, we mean a full-scale mock up or creation with all perceptics, full color, motion, emotion, interactions, reactions, density, energy consumed or generated, space it will occupy, time it will persist, and object and forms it or they will take.  This also includes the opposing color, opposing motion, opposing emotion, opposing interactions, opposing reactions, opposing densities, opposing energy consumed or generated, opposing space it occupies, opposing time it will persist, and opposing objects and forms it or they will take.</p> <p>When you are affected by an Ascension Experience, what takes place is, you move into a higher self.  In most cases you move into a state of MASTERFULNESS.  This state is very empowering.  It is a time that, as a spiritual being, you occupied much more space than just your body.  An awareness of yourself as having a position of masterfulness with god-like abilities and having tremendous spiritual powers.</p> <p>This is where the trouble begins, for as well as unlocking the god-like powers within you, you also unlock the negative side of your powers.  This is the two-edged sword effect of empowerment and ascension.</p> <p>It is this two-edged sword effect that has booby-trapped all empowerment and ascension transformational practices.</p> <p>In most cases, when an Ascension Experience takes place, your life will take on almost miraculous qualities and you will find that your dreams become actualities.  But a dark side will also begin to manifest.  Sudden losses or overwhelming problems begin to appear. Partnerships become destructive.  Marriage problems seem to intensify, often leading to divorce.</p> <p>What has happened?</p> <p>At the same time that you empowered your dreams, you also involuntarily empowered your nightmares.</p> <p>For example: You may be out with friends drinking and having a good time.  Suddenly you experience a massive high (Ascension Experience).  You\u2019re out of your body, your personality and wit are brilliant.  The evening is magic.</p> <p>To reexperience that high it is necessary to mentally replicate, in three-dimensional form, the same set of circumstances and cause it to manifest in the physical universe so that the drinking, the spending money, the late night with your friends will again produce a massive high.  This is repeated over and over again until you decide you are spending too much money.  But you now have an uncontrollable urge to drink.\u2019</p> <p>Now you cannot stop drinking.  That is an involuntary replication.</p> <p>Another example: You are madly in love with someone and they tell you that they have found a new love.  You are in shock.  You are overwhelmed.  Your heart is broken.  You cannot stop thinking about what happened.  You are stuck in an involuntary replication of loss and destruction of your dreams and aspirations.  Additionally, it may trigger earlier losses and heartbreaks, which intensifies the present time involuntary replication.</p> <p>Another example: Your father was an alcoholic, abusive type of person with a violent temper.  You vowed to yourself you would never have anything to do with that type of person.  Yet somehow you always end up with that type of person in your life.  That is an involuntary replication.</p> <p>All unwanted life situations stem from involuntary replications. When your life is not working, there are involuntary replications.</p> <p>You have involuntary replications if you suffer from:</p> <p>Procrastination</p> <p>Low mood level</p> <p>Can\u2019t handle time</p> <p>Can\u2019t handle money</p> <p>Success reluctance</p> <p>Closing reluctance</p> <p>Income reluctance</p> <p>Organizing reluctance</p> <p>Happiness reluctance</p> <p>Planning reluctance</p> <p>Wealth reluctance</p> <p>Trust reluctance</p> <p>Relationship reluctance</p> <p>Fear of failure</p> <p>Fear of making a fool of yourself</p> <p>Making the important unimportant</p> <p>Making the unimportant important</p> <p>Fear</p> <p>Can\u2019t concentrate or focus</p> <p>etc.</p> <p>All the above stem from involuntary replications that are sapping and misdirecting your power.</p> <p>Behind all involuntary replications are Ascension Experiences.</p>"},{"location":"ascension.html#the-involuntary-replication-destructive-phenomena","title":"THE INVOLUNTARY REPLICATION DESTRUCTIVE PHENOMENA","text":"<p>The basic destructive problem that lies inherent in an involuntary replication is that it creates, unknowingly to you, a telepathic projector of negative images that compulsively attract unknown and hidden others who have similar or identical negative images.

Being consider them very valuable, very scarce.</p> <p>If you do that step you will quickly recover the Beings Ability to mock up, you are probably getting that product anyway, but by getting the pc to take ownership of the mock-up, you increase their control of mock-ups a hundredfold.</p> <p>Every WANT the BEING has ever WANTED, creates an independent time line. So it is possible to have thousands of independant time lines. That is the biggest liability of Dianetic processing. No biggie. Unless they have too much Dianetic processing.</p> <p>My rule of thumb, is simple: Are you at cause over mental image pictures. End of dianetics. Most pcs get this state, when they get off their biggest withholds, but not always. At cause over MIP\u2019s does not mean there are no Engrams to run, it just means the pc is willing to confront any MIP.</p> <p>I tend to switch to Scio style at that time, only handling the occassional heavy incident if needed dianetically, If you let them, most being will turn on engrams for the fun of it, so they have some content to talk about.</p> <p>Another vital missing piece of tech. lots of people today can create holographically, if you run Dn on them, it acts as a degraded process, it\u2019ll cave them in.</p> <p>At the basic of All chains is an identity. Blow the identity and you blow the chain, Blow the Holo Vision And you blow the identity, etc, back to the WANT I have the exact sequencing on my web-page, Its part of the WANTS processing, sorry can\u2019t remember bulletins name.</p> <p>GPM\u2019s only come apart from the top down, I dont use the old LRH way as it has too many missing steps. It takes roughly 20 to 40 minutes to handle the full Games Matrix, the pc often cant be audited much for a while other than Celebration of Wins types of processing because, as the Games Matrix unravels the whole matrix the pc has been creating for that time, begins to unravel, the pc spends weeks expanding back into its own space.</p> <p>What you have discovered is a wonderful way to bring the Being out of the tar on a gentle but powerful gradient. Up to the running and successful handling of more and more fixed conditions, The only liability to any of these tech\u2019s is, if the Being is locked in mortal combat in present time with a very active opponent. This stops the unfolding.</p> <p>The more active crap the pc is engaged in, in PT, the slower and more easily the unraveling stops, the gains stop at that moment.</p> <p>Hope this helps but it is a vast subject and I have written 100\u2019s of bulletins and I believe 28 tapes on the subject, but most of them are now obsolete. So I have to make a new set of materials.</p> <p>A fantastic breakthrough piece of technology!!! Obviously a vital new piece of the over all puzzle. NEEDS ITS OWN PROPRIETARY NAME.</p> <p>Had LRH had your rundown, then GPM tech could have been mastered, the problem was there were too many student who were still stuck in the tar.</p> <p>Super Beings( OT\u2019s) are made from the top down, that is later similar. Many pcs are quite capable of this, some with as little as 25 hours can run easily, but like everything else there are those that cant.</p> <p>As flattered as I am by Alan\u2019s answer, especially considering his  extensive technical knowledge and experience,  on looking  back I noticed my original question had not been answered.</p> <p>In the past I\u2019ve dealt with engrams, ser facs, secondaries,  locks, and BTs (I can\u2019t think of any other fundamental  aspects of case at the moment)</p> <p>My question still remains:  What have I been dealing with?</p> <p>realize the only way I can truly answer your question is by knowing exactly what was run and how did it run out.</p> <p>There is a very specific life unravelling phenomena connected to the running of GPM\u2019s. Once you\u2019ve experienced it, you will know it. Again you will get hamonics of this</p> <p>Maybe Alan can enlighten me on something I was not heretofore  aware of. </p> <p>Hope this helps.</p> <p>Why give its own proprietary name?</p> <p>Ron always gave any changed r/d, its own name. R2-12 is GPM tech done differently, so he gave it its own name.</p> <p>Games Matrix incorporates GPM tech. But I gave it, its own name.</p> <p>I know that by calling it GPM tech it positions you against a very famous and somewhat alluring technology. Then you run into a bunch of opposition by some loony \u201cold timer\u2019s,\u201d who start yelling Flunk, Squirrel, Fraud.</p> <p>Now you have a new PT truncated GPM in the making. Not fair is it?</p> <p>Tech rundowns have lives of their own, if it is great, it becomes its own entity, much better giving its own name for it has the possibilities of becoming a huge, must not be without pieces of tech. that everyone boasts about getting.</p> <p>The greatness of R2-12 was you survived it. When some old timer says I did R2-12 all the other old timers respect soars for that person.

The intention is to use your own power to totally immobilize you and your paradigm machinery and destroy any desire to want or be anyone or anything.  You end up soulless and godless.</p> <p>Anyone who thought differently from the powers that be, or were criminals were targets for this program.</p> <p>To make sure that these implants and programs are never unlocked and vanished, all types of therapists are portrayed as evil villains; as secret destroyers of you.</p> <p>Also implanted are visuals of you being a serial killer and rapist of therapists, thus you must not be found out.</p> <p>False harmful acts are a great way to cause you to restrain and keep yourself and your past hidden.</p> <p>Outside of the physical universe, these program incidents can be an enforced reality done by telepathic imagery, with the being captured and held in place by tractor beams and presser beams, and can often contain blanketing, blackness, and invisibility.</p> <p>They can stem from multiple beings projecting their images with great force as a constant barrage into the being\u2019s universe in such great volume that the being can no longer work out which images are his and which are those of others!</p> <p>This sends the being into a constant introspection of self, trying to unlock the massive puzzle of \u201cWho am I; what am I; where am I; when am I; why am I; how am I; what are my intentions; what are my images; what are my moods; what is my mind; what are my motions; what are my outcomes, and what are my consequences?\u201d</p> <p>These types of psychic implants leave the being constantly in doubt, uncertain, unable to hold a position, and destroys its ability to create and have space, time, energy, and objects.</p> <p>These vicious implants create very destructive YOUICCIs (Your Obsessive, Unknowing, Involuntarily-Created Commanding Identities that are extremely difficult to find and handle because they pose an enormous threat to your present identity and its life and livingness.</p> <p>In discovering whether you have been a victim of these evil technologists, you will notice that you have non-sequential daydreams of being a great writer, or film star, or business tycoon, yet you never implement those daydreams.</p> <p>These are memories of former greatness pushing through, but they also trigger the destructive YOU MUST NOT BE programs that have been implanted to control, dominate, or subjugate you.  Added to this, you have created YOUICCIs that have cemented you into degraded denial of past or present small game playing, inconsequential identities.</p> <p>As you rise up the Chart of Ascension, you will begin to hit into identities that you must not be; identities that have been booby-trapped by past evil groups that have decided you must be kept small.</p> <p>I have been aware of this destructive, evil programming for a long time but didn\u2019t realize the extent of it, or the secrecy and the power of the denials and the destructiveness of the commands, nor the damage that the occlusion caused to your control of your paradigms or life.</p> <p>The biggest surprise was the way in which these evil programs were kept secret and held in place, and that they did not show up in the course of standard processing and training.  They were meant to not be discovered.  The Evil Technologists were well aware that someone in the future would discover how to unlock people\u2019s potential but they have done their damnedest to make sure their destructive programs stay hidden and locked up.  They even have destructive programs laid in to counter any processing techniques that could undo them; programs so designed that any near-miss will access and put into play automatic self-destructs and opposition-to-help paradigms that will drive you away from those who have helped or befriended you.</p> <p>The biggest trigger is the big blowout phenomenon, or the leaving of the body (out-of-body experience), death, or near-death of a body. These freedom of spirit experiences trigger the blackness, occlusion, and denials of who or what you are.  Nor can you envision AND MAINTAIN NEW FUTURES.</p> <p>You are dealing with massive betrayals of trust when you collide with implants.</p> <p>If you suspect that you or your client have triggered one of these evil programs, you need to do the following steps on the ABL.</p> <p>It should be noted that an implant is a very upsetting, paradigm-crashing incident.  The ABL may not read well, or the being is so upset that the ABL will not manifest at all.  You can observe the client looking sad, grim, or very solid.  If you run into this phenomenon, you will have to use the attention and interest of the client to guide you.</p> <p>If there is no manifestation on the ABL when you ask the client the question, you ask, \u201cDo you have anything on that?\u201d</p> <p>Invite the client to look and communicate what is there.  Do not hassle the client in any way.  As the incident breaks up and the force dissipates, more and more parts of the implant will come to view.</p> <p>Never, never, never make the client wrong for not being able to see what is there.</p> <p>You must be aware that this implant may have ruined your client\u2019s future for a very, very long time.</p> <p>It takes very kind, gentle work with handling to unlock and dissipate implants.  Any roughness, make wrong, or accusation will cause the client to misidentify the processor as an implanter.  This violates the safety of the session and the client will be stuck in the implant, fighting the implanter - you - and the technology.</p> <p>Work with the client and keep them informed as to what is going on. Do not lie or pretend, or the client will distrust you.</p> <p>You must keep in mind also that you are looking for WHAT HAS ACCESSED THE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAM, NOT THE PROGRAM.</p> <p>Program incidents cause the client\u2019s universe to collapse inward. Consequently the client gets buried by his mind, identities and environment. Quite often there is so much force, confusion, stupidity, and misownership connected to these program incidents that the meter will not manifest properly.  Often you will get a gradual speeded rising of the resistance value.  Thus, the best method of handling these questions is by slow, two way assessment.  That is, you ask the question and let the client look and answer the question.  The meter will start to manifest as they answer.</p> <p>Definition:</p> <p>PRACTICE: n.  1.

There are virtually no limits on how many subjects you can Clean Slate, or how long you can co-process with this procedure.</p> <p>For those who are new to the procedure, we are including a brief excerpt from the Knowledgism Discussion Group during September 1996.  A  newcomer to the technology asked some questions about the procedure:</p> <p>Date: Sat Sep 28 / 18:36:17 CDT 1996 From: Gary York / Subject: A Clean Slate Technical Question</p> <p>My question is how rigorously to adhere to the text of the procedure. Particularly, from item 8 onwards, most of the questions or double questions are to be repeated:</p> <p>\u201cRepeat over and over until the person has a rise in mood level, an increase in certainty, a realization (or Aha!), regained abilities, a big win, and huge quantities of recovered life-force particles.</p> <p>If the person says, \u201cThat\u2019s all there is.\u201d  I suppose it could count as an \u201cincrease in certainty.\u201d  But what if they look like they just got hit by a truck? (You know what I mean.  They ain\u2019t there yet!)</p> <p>So far, I\u2019ve been inclined to take a real relaxed approach and avoid anything like a fire-fight. Occasionally, if it seems right, I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cAlright. How about if we go over it one more time just to see if there\u2019s anything left over?\u201d  And if I get easy agreement, fine.  If not, I\u2019ll hope a later question does the job.</p> <p>My courage, so far, does not extend to, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re dodging something here or just afraid to look.  We\u2019re keeping at this until you\u2019re uptone, damn it!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m going to be \u201cClean Slating\u201d several people and I want them to get all the gain possible from the procedure.  If I need to get more couragous, I\u2019ll do it.</p> <p>Any advice?</p> <p>Date: Sat Sep 28, 1996 From: ACW / Subject:  The client always has \u201cthe right of way.\u201d</p> <p>When a client cannot see anything or that is all, don\u2019t force them, continue onto the next step.</p> <p>To do anything else is abusive.</p> <p>You must at all times maintain the utmost honesty with the client. Now, if the client isn\u2019t running right, you have a problem! You must not process over a problem.</p> <p>Just tell the client \u201cthis is not running right. I need to check with the Case Adviser. Is this o.k?\u201d</p> <p>Sessions should never be \u201cordeals\u201d for either the client or the processor. If they are, then someone is being ABUSIVE and someone is being ABUSED. Never force the client or yourself. End the session, take a walk, call the case adviser. But DO NOT FORCE THE SESSION!!</p> <p>Usually when a client \u201cwill not look,\u201d \u201ccan not look,\u201d  runs very shallow, you probably have someone with very \u201cout fundamentals.\u201d Don\u2019t make it worse by forcing or blaming them. It means you are not asking the right questions or or not addressing the right area with the right process.</p> <p>This is not a crime. It means exactly what it means. Session success very much depends on the weaponry of the processor. If you are just starting out, you have a very limited \u201crepertoire\u201d of procedures. Thus there a many more people you will not get results on. Its as simple as that.</p> <p>Clean Slate works on the majority of clients, but if the client has some huge secret, upset, problem or inability to communicate, etc. You must have many more skills.</p> <p>Don\u2019t beat yourself or the client to death over this. Just admit the truth. You don\u2019t know how to handle this! If you pretend you do, you will degrade the client into thinking there is something seriously wrong with him, plus you will find you begin to hate processing people. TOO MUCH FALSE PROCESSING AND YOU WILL CEASE TO WANT TO PROCESS ANYONE, EVER AGAIN!!</p> <p>Not only that you will pull in FALSE PROCESSING PROBLEMS ON YOUR OWN CASE AND NOT WANT TO BE PROCESSED ANYMORE.</p> <p>How do you know when someone doesn\u2019t want processing anymore? THEY DONT GET PROCESSED! Not for years and years and years, ad infinitum.</p> <p>The motto of a truly great processor is: HONOR THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION.</p> <p>I can feel all you fearful processors and ABUSED clients, sighing with relief.</p> <p>Hope this helps.</p> <p>Love, Alan</p> <p>The following is a message written by Alan C. Walter, and initially posted to participants in the Knowledgism Discussion Group.  When Alan saw the many success stories by participants in the group who have had dramatic wins using the Clean Slate Procedures that he developed, Alan wrote the following:</p> <p>It is very gratifying to see so many wins being posted on these pages.</p> <p>Thank you all!</p> <p>I\u2019d like to tell you the real History and Power of the Clean Slate Process.</p> <p>As many of you know I have been at this game now for forty years.</p> <p>Most of those forty years have included 10,000\u2019s of hours of one on one processing.</p> <p>Plus handling 100,000\u2019s of hours of others cases.</p> <p>As the years rolled by, I was able to observe the changes taking place in the public at large, those who were unprocessed and untrained.</p> <p>The change that was most noticable for me were twofold.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The public were getting more and more aware.</p> </li> <li> <p>The public were getting more charged up. That is their cases were</p> </li> </ol> <p>much more easily over-accessed. (over-restimulated.)</p> <p>This made handling them almost impossible. Further it brought into play a basic law.  NEVER PROCESS SOMEONE OVER BY-PASSED CHARGE.</p> <p>By-passed charge is that charge stemming from a past upsetting incident, that has been activated and missed. This leaves a Being in a continuous state of inner turmoil.</p> <p>Processing is simply; \u201casking a person a question they can understand, educing an answer you can understand, and letting them know they had been understood. Simple enough. But there-in lay the booby-trap. When you asked a question it would almost, always activate the prior by-passed charge. Even reading anything that would cause an upward inspection of their life did the same thing. Activated by-pass charge. This is why today\u2019s education is failing. The teachers are activating by-passed charge. But they do not have the technology to handle it.</p> <p>No-one did.</p> <p>For, so over-charged were most people, that they couldn\u2019t even stay in one place long enough to get the by-passed charge handled.</p> <p>Knowing how to handle by-passed charge has been the hidden secret of my successes over the years. The only time I have lost, was when I was prevented from doing it. Or, I had so much by-passed myself, that I activated everyone\u2019s by-passed charge around me. Real bummer that!!</p> <p>So what to do? How could I handle this? For at that time handling by-passed charge well, was an extremely skilled activity. Another problem was almost no-one wanted to go near by-passed charge.</p> <p>The only answer was design a procedure that would incorporate both PROCESSING \u2014 BY-PASSED CHARGE HANDLING \u2014 RESTORATION OF POWER HANDLING \u2014 RESTORATION OF SPIRITUALITY \u2014 RESTORATION OF YOU THE SPIRITUAL BEING HANDLING.</p> <p>Make it so easy almost anyone can do it with a minimum amount of training. The major reason for this was: If we do not process those around us, the civilization will self-destruct. This is gathering momentum as you read this. We need millions of clean slaters.</p> <p>The Clean Slate Procedures are the result of those problems needing to be handled.</p> <p>Clean Slate is a combination processing \u2014 by-passed charge handling and spiritual restoration technology. It is designed to run on any case at any level at anytime. It can go as low as the bottom of the Red Zone or as high as the top of the GOLD ZONE.   Further it is unlimited in regards subjects. Thus it is an infinite process, when combined with the action processes and presence processes. You can handle ALL lower unwanted case conditions on the client, in any area of the the Physical Universe.</p> <p>The interesting thing is, the more charge you get off your case the more powerful the process becomes. If you would Clean Slate ALL Green Zone aspects of the Life Analysis and Skills Analysis Profiles you would find your life has become a magical adventure. Full of fun, laughter, success and prosperity.</p> <p>In the hands of a well trained processor, there are no unwanted life conditions that can not be aleviated, more likely they will be fully handled. The biggest problem most people have, is being able to have the size of wins. Many stop, because their lives change upwards so much, they have to put some order into it.</p> <p>Such a problem?</p> <p>The other problem is those around them begin to get very agitated at the increased power and awareness of you; to continue winning, ALL those connected to you should Clean Slate process also. To be able to operate optimumly in life, it is VITAL to have those connected to you, willing for you to win big, and able to have you win big.</p> <p>That takes a safe space and aware powerful friends.</p> <p>The only way I know to produce that situation is, make sure All those \u201cfriends\u201d of yours are travelling in the same direction, UPWARD INTO THE GREEN ZONE and beyond.</p> <p>Again thanks for being the pioneers for a new civilization.</p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Alan.</p> <p>For more information on this procedure refer to:</p> <p>http://www.knowledgism.com</p> <p>e-mail leader@knowledgism.com</p> <p>Or call:</p> <p>Voice:  972-404-8125 FAX:    972-404-8821</p> <p>The Institute of Applied Knowledge 3330 Earhart Drive, Suite 213 Dallas, TX  75006</p> <p>Copyright 1996 All Rights Reserved</p>"},{"location":"cs2.html","title":"Clean Slate Process II","text":""},{"location":"cs2.html#clean-slate-process-ii-misrepresented-identity-or-object-handling-steps","title":"CLEAN SLATE PROCESS II \u2014 MISREPRESENTED IDENTITY OR OBJECT HANDLING STEPS","text":"<p>This process is run on a person to clean up any past dirty slates that another person, place or thing has triggered.

That is why you cannot recover from past upsets and hatred without processing.</p> <p>Only processing can focus enough attention and truth to the EXACT CAUSE of the upset, problem, or hatred.  It is a specific cause, but it is never what you thought it was.  For if it were you would have correct who, what, when, where, why, and how and that would put you in a high mood level and you would have loved more, not hated.  HATE always, always, always denotes incorrect whos, whats, whens, wheres, whys, hows, and moods.</p> <p>When you see someone who\u2019s life is not working and they hate, you have someone who is operating on an incorrect who, what, when, where, why, how or mood.</p> <p>A lecture will not fix them.  A pep talk will not fix them.  Nothing will fix them but to recontact the point life went wrong and find the real truth and recover full cause indicators. That can only be done in a proper processing session.</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry there are no other answers.  You want to be fully yourself, you have to unlock your past and be responsible for the false and incorrect answers and actions you\u2019ve polluted the universe with.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth will set you free\u201d is a perfect statement so long as you go into session and find the exact who, what, when, where, why, how and mood that entered the lie in the first place and began the decline.</p> <p>When you don\u2019t process and train, you\u2019re stuck with your lies forever. When you don\u2019t get others to process and train, you\u2019re stuck with their lies forever.  Lies are the basis of hatred.  People who do not process are stuck in their hatreds for eternity.</p> <p>Failure to process and train your environment dooms you to live in an environment of hatred and sabotage.  Only you can change that.  Fail to act and your environment will act against you.  But, it will be much more painful as you once experienced love, hope and a chance your dreams would become realities.</p> <p>A high price to pay indeed.  So act now.</p> <p>ALAN C.

This lack of subject or area knowledge can cause the being to feel very uncertain, insecure, fearful and unable to approach the subject or area.</p> <ol> <li>Too much dishonesty.</li> </ol> <p>Any dishonesty violates a beings virtues and principles.  Too much dishonesty causes the being to lose or entrap too many life force particles and thus implode in on itself, disestablishing or unmocking its position or creation.</p> <ol> <li>Too many mis-ownerships.</li> </ol> <p>Too many mis-ownerships of cultural ideas of how a being should behave or think or other lesser beings false, abusive or destructive ideas, telepathically projected imagery or wrong items can create a totally false case condition causing the feeling you can never master or handle your own case or life.</p> <ol> <li>Too much pain and unpleasant sensations.</li> </ol> <p>The pain and unpleasant sensations stem from your disagreements, objections, opposition, fighting, sabotaging and then finally succumbing and becoming overwhelmed by the dishonesty and mis-ownership activities and factors.</p> <ol> <li>Too many counter created identities, counter circuits and counter machines.</li> </ol> <p>In order to handle and suppress real or imagined psychic evil done by you or done by others, you have created counter identities, counter circuits and counter machines.

That is you are unwilling to stick your neck out, unwilling or unable to be responsible for an area, etc.  Technically that indicates lack of hatting, hidden unresolved study problems, limiting precepts, unwillingness to make self known, poor discipline, low levels of integrity, poor standards of disciple, attitudes of mediocracy, lack of experience.
