<p>The data contained in this report is my data, as viewed by me.
It is not your data, though you may have similars of your own.</p>
<p>Each being’s case is uniquely their own.</p>
<p>For example, there are hundreds of thousands of car crashes every
year.  But each crash is unique unto itself.  Each happened in a
different place and time.  Even if there were several of you in the
same crash, you each occupied a slightly different position, thus you
have a completely different viewpoint of what happened.</p>
<p>It is the same for manifestations of events in the different
universes.  The event may be similar, but you were in a different time
and place than where any other spiritual being.  Therefore what
happened to you may be similar, but in actuality is quite different.
Not only is what happened different, but HOW you responded to the
event can be dramatically different.</p>
<p>This means that each case is handled as a completely different
practice and is completely unique unto itself.  Now we can maintain a
purity and uniqueness of individual personalized technology.</p>
<p>Your battles and wars down through time are uniquely your own.
Who you are still at war with is uniquely your choice of targets.
What problems you manage to choose to have to avoid, what it is you do
not want to be responsible for, are unique to you.</p>
<p>The method of game playing and identity you employ so that you
can maintain your disguises and stay hidden, is strictly of your
choosing.</p>

<p>Failure to do so means you are in a losing battle with a long
term enemy.  (And they HAVE convinced you to stay much less than you
can be.)</p>
<p>Many will find &ldquo;more important things to do,&rdquo; rather than
confront their next step.  Or so it will appear to them.</p>
<p>The truth is they are still at war with someone or something who
has convinced them they will not survive unless they handle &ldquo;this
immediate problem.&rdquo; &ldquo;This immediate problem&rdquo; has been made more
important than they are; a deliberate intention to degrade a being.</p>
<p>When you take an upward step you are going into the next higher
layer of force, pain, subject illiteracy, charge and chaos on your
case.</p>
<p>The path all the way back to full operating Super Being potential
is through bigger and bigger amounts of violent force, pain, subject
illiteracy, charge and chaos.  It is a tough, grueling, yet thrilling
adventure.</p>
<p>The greatest problem with taking your next upward step is, you
collide into your next area of non permeation.  This can cause you to
have no time, no space, no interest, no energy (no money), no
presence, and go into complete elsewhereness or immobility.</p>
<p>Your enemies will gleefully go into agreement that you cannot
possibly afford the time, the money, or the effort, thus solidifying
you into the reality of no money, no time and no intention to upgrade
yourself.</p>
<p>You have been engaged in a total soul destroying activity.</p>
<p>It is time you ended this game.</p>
<p>It is a done.  Over.  Finished.  Gone on too long.  Stupid.
Nasty.  Ridiculous activity.</p>

<p>The spiritual universes of mankind have been at war for a very,
very long time.  It was not just a physical universe war, but
something much more deadly; a PSYCHIC WAR.</p>
<p>The spiritual beings throughout the universes were and are locked
in mortal combat with each other.</p>
<p>This war was based upon:</p>
<p>SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE vs.  SPIRITUAL IGNORANCE</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-opponents">THE OPPONENTS<a class="headerlink" href="#the-opponents" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are certain groups of “Evil Beings” who were or are
dedicated to the subduing, enslaving and destruction of all spiritual
life forces.</p>
<p>Their ultimate weapon to produce the subduing, enslavement and
destruction of all spirituality is or was &ldquo;the active constant
production of ignorance of spirituality created by active, constant
wrong answers about life, false or deceptive ideas, delusions or
dishonesties, all heavily encased in psychic pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the deliberate, active, constant dumbing down of every
spiritual being.  Nothing could be dumber, than to not be aware of
your spiritual potentiality and spiritual powers.</p>
<h2 id="what-set-this-weapon-into-play-was-the-continuous-use-of-destructive-telepathically-projected-holographic-imagery-by-evil-beings-that-constantly-created-other-spiritual-beings-as-something-less-than-they-truly-are">WHAT SET THIS WEAPON INTO PLAY WAS THE CONTINUOUS USE OF DESTRUCTIVE TELEPATHICALLY PROJECTED HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGERY BY EVIL BEINGS THAT CONSTANTLY CREATED OTHER SPIRITUAL BEINGS AS SOMETHING LESS THAN THEY TRULY ARE.<a class="headerlink" href="#what-set-this-weapon-into-play-was-the-continuous-use-of-destructive-telepathically-projected-holographic-imagery-by-evil-beings-that-constantly-created-other-spiritual-beings-as-something-less-than-they-truly-are" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>By using ignorance encased in psychic pain to destroy the
Spiritual Beings’ ability to know and holographically permeate the
truth, the &ldquo;Evil Beings&rdquo; effectively nullified the knowledge of the
God or God-like beings.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Evil Beings&rdquo; practiced the misuse or destructive use of
their abilities to psychically use their knowledge to telepathically
project holographic imagery to create other spiritual beings as
something less than they truly are.</p>
<h2 id="why-were-we-at-war">WHY WERE WE AT WAR?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-were-we-at-war" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are four basic psychic harmful or destructive acts that are
committed by warring aberrant spiritual beings.  They are:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-inability-or-failure-or-refusal-to-be-present">1.  THE INABILITY, OR FAILURE, OR REFUSAL TO BE PRESENT.<a class="headerlink" href="#1-the-inability-or-failure-or-refusal-to-be-present" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The lack of presence creates an absence of causativeness,
awareness, observation and empowerment.  This in turn causes an
inability to evaluate importances, to correctly estimate the amount of
effort to accomplish what is wanted, and to correctly estimate the
values or worth of someone or something (the major source of most
being’s inability to appreciate others as well as a major contributor
to manufacturing immense financial difficulties).</p>
<p>The lack of presence is a refusal to be responsible for, to own
and maintain control of someone or something including oneself.</p>
<p>When a spiritual being goes absent, the resultant vacuum implodes
the positions and spacation in which your creation and identity exists
in.  This causes the degradation or destruction of your positive
dreams, aspirations, creations and identities.</p>
<p>The resultant effects of this lack of presence and implosion
phenomena can trigger huge past losses and produce enormous rages,
upsets, shocks and collapsed universes.</p>
<p>The refusal to be present is a way to invisibly, while
maintaining great secrecy, destroy another’s or your spirituality.
This is accomplished by refusing to recognize the existence of another
or you as a spiritual being.</p>
<p>This is a deliberate form of harmful act in order to create the
ultimate degradation of a spiritual being.</p>
<p>By acting as a deliberate &ldquo;absent being&rdquo;, knowingly or
unknowingly, using the complete denial of self and others
spirituality, an &ldquo;absent being&rdquo; instantly causes the downgrade and
minimization of the powers, skills, abilities, cleverness, size, and
strengths, and ruins the ability to hold a close, friendly, warm,
position with anyone who they are connected to, thus creating
distance, unfriendliness, coldness and separation.</p>
<p>Without a spiritual being’s full presence, all you have in front
of you is a substitute programmed identity that is incapable of pure
love, truth or honor.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-inability-or-failure-or-refusal-to-holographically-permeate">2.  THE INABILITY, OR FAILURE, OR REFUSAL TO HOLOGRAPHICALLY PERMEATE.<a class="headerlink" href="#2-the-inability-or-failure-or-refusal-to-holographically-permeate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The lack of holographic permeation is the basic barrier to
attaining the purity of truth, knowledge, love, mastery and oneness
with someone or something, including your and anothers creations and
spirituality.</p>
<p>By refusing to holographically permeate, you are holding in place
compulsive separation from or compulsive opposition toward someone or
something, selective perceptions, selective observations of how you
will evaluate the worth or the quality of behavior (good or bad).</p>
<p>You are desperately holding on to your fixed ideas in order to
hold off the pain and confusion that lies behind your unwillingness to
holographically permeate.</p>
<p>You are setting yourself up to be right, not truthful, to make
others wrong, to disguise who you really are, what you are really
doing, what your true intention really is, what game you are really
playing.</p>
<p>You also create inhibiting and degrading belief systems designed
to avoid what needs to be holographically permeated.</p>
<p>To maintain your disguises it is necessary for you to suppress
yours and others abilities to holographically permeate.</p>

<p>The lack of positive or upgrading telepathic imagery on to others
and yourself is a form of powerful destructive, degrading negative
processing.</p>
<p>It is the prime cause of how we have subdued, degraded and
destroyed the power and awareness of each other.</p>
<p>Using negative imagery is the action of derogatory labeling or
destructive criticism without including how to upgrade or remedy the
situation.  It is the vile action of pointing out something that is
wrong or incorrect, but being too cowardly to do something about it.</p>
<p>This is the coward&rsquo;s way of pretending to be right, but the
coward is secretly disguising an evil intention to make less or
nothing of the spirituality of someone or something.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;evil beings&rdquo; are attempting to subdue, degrade or destroy
another spiritual being by making degrading telepathically projected
images in order to create them as less than they truly are.  If you
are about to do this degrading imagery, you must first adopt a similar
identity that approximates the degrading image you are about to
create.  This action causes you to lower your mood level, and adopt an
even weaker more degrading identity for yourself.  A very self
sabotaging destructive act.</p>
<p>This behavior is why so many beings are engaged in very
unimportant, small, massive wastes of time and effort games, i.e.
chasing bags of wind in your underwear (e.g.  football, basketball,
etc.)</p>
<h5 id="the-secret-weapon-of-spiritual-domination">THE SECRET WEAPON OF SPIRITUAL DOMINATION<a class="headerlink" href="#the-secret-weapon-of-spiritual-domination" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>How does a being justify making it okay to telepathically project
degrading imagery?</p>
<p>The evil being uses this viscious, disintegrator-of-the-spirit
secret weapon to dominate, subjugate, torture and torment in order to
produce a life full of incidents of tedium, ordeal and grim
unhappiness.</p>
<p>What is this terrible weapon?</p>
<h5 id="unreachable-perfectionism">UNREACHABLE PERFECTIONISM.<a class="headerlink" href="#unreachable-perfectionism" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>This is the reverse use of telepathically projected imagery; its
intent is to set impossible to achieve concepts, visions and
standards.</p>
<p>Unreachable perfectionism is a horribly viscous, deadly,
soul-destroying concept as it sets an impossible to reach standard to
live up to.  The fact the standard is unattainable makes anyone who
goes into action in an attempt to reach for the impossible standard, a
loser forever.</p>
<p>Unreachable perfection is the favorite tool of the abuser.  The
abuser sets as its standards a secret unknown unreachable perfect
image.  When you do not and cannot meet those unmeetable standards,
the abuser becomes enraged, they attack you.  You are already caved in
from failing to meet the unreachable perfectionism; you cannot hold
your position, you and your universe collapse.</p>
<p>What is even more deadly is you will begin to compulsively ask
yourself unanswerable questions, finding wrong answer after wrong
answer to life.  This activity guarantees you an unsuccessful, deeply
unhappy life.  Your wrong answers act as degraded image creations of
yourself, that you now act out in life.</p>
<p>Unreachable perfectionism allows any evil-intended being to use
your failure to live up to that unreachable imagery as an absolute
right, with total justification, to use heavy force to smash you into
nothingness.</p>
<p>They do this by creating degraded or destructive telepathically
projected imagery of you as something less than you are.  Then they
get others to create the same type of imagery and fuse them together
thus creating mutual agreements, in an attempt to mold you into the
degraded identity they have created you as.</p>
<p>Having high standards, high dreams, high expectations, and high
visions are sane uplifting future-creating set of creations.</p>
<p>Being the slave, in a constant state of misery, near collapse and
never able to win, a hopeless victim of unreachable perfectionism, is
insane and will destroy any spiritual being and make nothing of their
psychic powers.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-inability-or-failure-or-refusal-to-acknowledge-or-appreciate">4.  THE INABILITY, OR FAILURE, OR REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR APPRECIATE.<a class="headerlink" href="#4-the-inability-or-failure-or-refusal-to-acknowledge-or-appreciate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The lack of acknowledgment or appreciation can produce disastrous
effects on others and yourself.</p>
<p>The reason for this is, non acknowledgment and non appreciation
is an overt denial and make nothing of yours or another&rsquo;s existence,
help or creation.</p>
<p>To a spiritual being, a creation is its highest demonstration of
competence.  And help is its highest form of exchange and
demonstration of its worth.</p>
<p>When you deny a spiritual being its rightful acknowledgment or
grateful appreciation, you are making nothing of the being and
destroying the being&rsquo;s reason for existing.  So deadly can the lack of
acknowledgment and appreciation be, that a person being constantly
subject to this form of silent abuse can experience the sensation of
themselves and all of their creations disintegrating.</p>
<p>The major causes of poor communication skills (a sentence is a
creation), self doubt, uncertainty, insecurity, fear, worry, low
self-esteem, lack of self respect, lack of confidence, lack of focus,
lack of concentration and a lack of purpose can all be traced back to
non acknowledgment and non appreciation.</p>
<p>The deliberate use of non acknowledgment and non appreciation are
savage weapons of psychic destruction.</p>
<p>The ability to acknowledge and appreciate requires the
willingness to observe what is there, duplicate what is there,
holographically permeate what is there, and let who created what is
there know you admire and appreciate their creation, their beingness,
their existence and their presence.</p>
<p>But if you cannot face up to what is there (too much pain, hurt,
force and charge) you will not be able to acknowledge or appreciate.
YOU have become a weapon of destruction to yourself and others.</p>

<p>I have deliberately put the &ldquo;evil being&rdquo; designation in quotes as
anyone who opposes your goals is automatically categorized as an enemy
and is therefore evil.  All opponents are considered as evil.  This
makes you right and them wrong, plus it makes it okay to commit
monstrous harmful acts on them and those on their side who are in
mutual agreement with them.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;Evil Beings&rdquo; have committed, in your selective perception,
tremendous harmful acts that have violated your viewpoints of the
spiritual codes, the spiritual virtues and the spiritual principals of
The Supreme Being.  (That team of unique individual spiritual Gods who
once acted in a co-presence, co-operating, co-holographic permeating,
co-creating manner.)</p>
<p>These &ldquo;Evil Beings&rdquo; set out to subdue or destroy all &ldquo;opposing
spiritual beings&rdquo; who were able to restore their own personal
spiritual power to telepathically project holographic imagery, and who
then were capable of restoring the teams of Gods spiritual powers to
telepathically project holographic imagery.</p>

<p>Should any being misuse its psychic powers, a retribution will be
enacted against any form of awareness, literacy, knowledge, masterful
learning, and ownership belonging to that being.  This includes any
ability used to set spiritual beings or people free, any financial or
economic power that causes an ascension, and any validation of good
habits or production.  These all will also involuntarily bring on
oppression of these psychic abilities.</p>
<p>Any psychic abilities used by the psychic power misuser that lead
to the freeing of the spirit must all be implanted with false answers,
false events, false consequences and heavily coated with pain,
resulting in the operating psychic abilities being totally nullified
or destroyed.</p>
<p>Or, better still, the coated-with-pain area being further painted
over with false pictures, false scenarios, false meanings, false
answers, false times, false durations, false enemies, false reasons,
false gods, false religions, false symbols.  Then even more pain
coated over these.</p>
<p>Then a further round of false purposes, false goals, false
intentions, altered importances, false events plus pain, false view
points plus pain, betrayal plus pain, chaos plus pain, stupidity plus
pain, ridicule plus pain, righteousness plus immense quantities of
pain for those who followed the righteous ones.</p>
<p>Culminating in an identity that falsely operates in pretense and
self delusion of doing false good deeds and providing false and
destructive help.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-term-program-battle-plan">THE LONG TERM PROGRAM BATTLE PLAN<a class="headerlink" href="#the-long-term-program-battle-plan" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This behavior creates an evil type of identity that produces
incidents of ultimate betrayal, which in turn creates an even more
degraded self destructive evil identity that now goes around being &ldquo;a
victim of an ultimate betrayer&rdquo; who is obsessively attracted to
&ldquo;ultimate betrayer&rdquo; evil identities, who will obsessively create more
betrayal situations.  This in turn proves or reinforces the fixed idea
for the &ldquo;victim&rdquo; that all people are basically bad.</p>
<p>By doing the above, the &ldquo;Evil Beings&rdquo; have created a vast network
of secret agents to work for them.</p>
<p>Each secret agent involuntarily replicates all that was done to
it.  Using these programs, it begins to create an even more secret
agent type of identity, known as a super secret reactionary sabotaging
agent.</p>
<p>The super secret reactionary sabotaging agents prime intention is
to act invisibly and stealthily, using misdirectors and false,
misdirecting forms of validations of how important and valuable
material objects are to the being, in order to place any available
life force particles elsewhere, preferably into a physical universe
object or better still into a body.</p>
<p>These covert series of actions are done in order to make sure the
secret or sabotaging agents are not discovered until they have
produced the complete nullification and destruction of any beings who
misuse their psychic powers.</p>
<p>A few million years go by.  During that period of time the secret
agents go to work replicating what the &ldquo;Evil Beings&rdquo; had programmed
them to do.  Now there are millions and millions of these super
secret, reactionary, sabotaging agents known as &ldquo;the ultimate
betrayers&rdquo; plus billions of their &ldquo;victims&rdquo; who have been continuously
subdued and sabotaged into nullification and destruction of their
spirituality for apparently misusing their psychic powers.</p>
<p>So dangerous is this to the honest spiritual godlike beings who
are being constantly driven into a self defensive mode that to handle
the constant threat and danger, they are forced to heavily disguise
themselves.</p>
<p>This covert WAR has been in progress for a very long time,
spanning many universes, continuously through time, each being driving
each other being into lesser and lesser states of awareness and more
and more losses of psychic powers into lower and lower degraded
identities that demonstrate continuously devastating incompetences.</p>
<p>The enemy has had an almost total victory, as the last of the
godlike beings are now so busy maintaining their disguises and have
been subdued into not using their psychic powers to enhance their&rsquo;s
and other&rsquo;s lives because they fear savage reprisals.</p>
<p>The main disguise in use is to approximate the operating
identities of being like, doing like and having like &ldquo;the ultimate
betrayers&rdquo; or their created &ldquo;victims.&rdquo; The Gods have become that which
they hate the most.</p>

<p>The moment of avoidance instantly creates them as one of &ldquo;THE
COWARDS OF THE UNIVERSE,&rdquo; for they have abandoned their
responsibilities and grossly violated their integrity, their codes,
their virtues and their principles.</p>
<p>They detest themselves for their abandonment of responsibility,
cowardice and avoidances.  Their self esteem is at rock bottom.  They
chronically whine and moan, attending meaningless rallies.  Play
meaningless small inconsequential games.  Make inane statements of how
life and people should be.</p>
<p>They talk about, know about, pontificate about but never cause or
produce any meaningful actions.  They are the great pretenders.  They
cannot and will not confront their pain, force or charge.</p>
<p>To maintain their avoidance, the coward&rsquo;s most consistent harmful
act is to make the unimportant important and the important
unimportant.  For if they were to make the important, important they
would immediately run into what they are trying to avoid, their pain
and hurt.</p>
<p>The one thing these cowards would never do is process someone!</p>
<p>For that would mean they would have to acknowledge they have
been, and are possibly still being, a secret agent of the &ldquo;Evil
Beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That most of us are trapped in a body in the physical universe is
a sign we all have been secret agents or super secret, reactionary,
sabotaging agents working on the side of the evil beings a multitude
of times.</p>
<p>These secret agents and super secret reactionary sabotaging
degrading identities are the most hidden, perfectly disguised, must
never be found out about, evil intended, evil operating, unknown,
involuntarily replicated, disgusting, insidious identities that are
ruining most cases and lives.</p>
<p>If you have ever behaved unwillingly in an insidious evil manner,
or unwillingly become just outright evil, then you have experienced
being taken over by your own involuntarily replicated &ldquo;evil being&rdquo;
created identities.</p>
<p>An evil identity is a major source of non-permeation as it
contains immense quantities of dishonesty, subject illiteracy,
misownership and excruciating pain that has spread throughout your
universes following the pathways of your existences lifetime after
lifetime of committing acts of betrayals.</p>
<p>Should you violate your secret agent status by becoming rich and
successful, don’t be surprised if you suddenly behave in a treacherous
or self sabotaging manner and start seducing others and betraying
those who love and trust you, as did Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, et
al who betrayed those who trusted them to be and do what they
promised.</p>
<h5 id="the-massive-universe-wide-ignorance-creation-conspiracy">THE MASSIVE UNIVERSE WIDE IGNORANCE CREATION CONSPIRACY<a class="headerlink" href="#the-massive-universe-wide-ignorance-creation-conspiracy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>There is a massive universe wide conspiracy to prevent the use of
psychic powers by blocking them with pain, with the total intention of
subjugating all spiritual beings and keeping all of them in a state of
complete &ldquo;overwhelming ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;overwhelming ignorance&rdquo; is held in place by the
conspirator&rsquo;s mutual use of involuntarily replicated fusions of
negative telepathically projected images of &ldquo;You must not find out&rdquo;
encased in heavy blackness and blankness.</p>
<p>Each co-conspirator&rsquo;s individual &ldquo;overwhelming
ignorance&rdquo;-creating-operating basis is founded on a REFUSAL TO KNOW or
a REFUSAL TO HOLOGRAPHICALLY PERMEATE THE TRUTH, which creates a
constant unwillingness to find out, thus causing great &ldquo;overwhelming
ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ability to create vast &ldquo;overwhelming ignorance&rdquo; can be
further enhanced by the continuous oppressive use of the following
precepts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree I will not find out about you, if you will not find out
about me.&rdquo; = A refusal to observe or inspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not know about you, if you will not know about me.&rdquo; = A
refusal to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not discover your secrets, if you will not discover my
secrets.&rdquo; = A refusal to be aware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not cause you to confront your pain, if you will not
cause me to confront my pain.&rdquo; = A refusal to be cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be responsible, if you will not be responsible.&rdquo; = A
refusal to be responsible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not observe or confront, if you will not observe or
confront.&rdquo; = A refusal to observe or confront.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be present, if you will not be present.&rdquo; = A refusal
to be present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not decide, if you will not decide.&rdquo; = A refusal to make
a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not help you, if you will not help me.&rdquo; = A refusal to
help or be helped.</p>
<p>These oppressive ignorance-creating precepts are used by the
conspirators to maintain the subjugation and prevent the unlocking of
psychic powers by blocking them and encasing them with ignorance,
surrounded by pain and hurt.</p>
<p>Anytime my life stalls or stops I ask myself &ldquo;What oppressive
ignorance creating precept have I gone into agreement with?&rdquo; The
answer would always bring to view what I was desperately trying to
avoid.  Over a period of 33 years, the use of that question has always
given me the correct answer.  Often an answer that contained lots of
pain and stupidity.</p>
<p>The contacting, confronting and permeation of truth, knowledge,
love, being present, being honest, study, true help, duplication of
what is, being aware, being at cause or any form of ascension have
become extremely painful.</p>
<p>The need for the conspirators to maintain every being in a state
of ignorance, subjugation, pain and hurt is vital to continue the
oppression and blocking of psychic powers.</p>
<p>It takes a tremendously brave, dedicated being to go up against
such a huge conspiracy of mutual, co-created, destructive agreements.</p>
<h2 id="the-casualties-of-the-war">THE CASUALTIES OF THE WAR<a class="headerlink" href="#the-casualties-of-the-war" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you observe a drunk, a drug user, a bankrupt person, a
divorced person, a derelict, a loser, a failure, an illiterate, a
moron, a depressed being, a mediocritite, someone who cannot study,
someone who cannot concentrate, a bad tempered individual, a
procrastinator, a success reluctant person, an unhappy person, you are
observing a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; identity, a casualty of the war.</p>
<p>When you discover someone acting as an ultimate betrayer, you
will observe destructive identities such as a child molester, a thief,
a murderer, an implanter, an embezzler, an arsonist, a liar, an
adulterer, a false prophet, a confidence man, a phony, a cheat, a
pretender, a Gestapo style being, etc., etc.  More casualties of the
war.</p>
<p>All bad, degraded, dysfunctional human conditions are the result
of being a casualty of the conspirators and their use of ignorance,
encased in pain and hurt in the continuous war to oppress the psychic
abilities of mankind.</p>
<p>Hostility, hatred, violence, ruin, disasters, upsets, bad
tempers, conflicts, fights, bankruptcies, divorce, depressions,
confusion, stupidity, etc., etc.  are the products of the psychic
wars.</p>
<p>If you cannot tell who your true friends are, it does make for a
difficult and paranoid life, especially if your friends suddenly turn
into &ldquo;subduers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;betrayers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wars are a lose - lose activity.  Everybody loses.</p>
<h5 id="the-war-has-ended">THE WAR HAS ENDED!!<a class="headerlink" href="#the-war-has-ended" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>On the 5<sup>th</sup> of March, 1994 a momentous event took place.</p>
<p>A series of advance research processing sessions.</p>
<p>The intent of this research was to investigate and handle the
case conditions created by the Evil Evil Being Universe.</p>
<p>I will not cover the details of what was found, but I can inform
you of the result of these sessions.</p>
<p>It was obvious that this EVIL BEING UNIVERSE area was the major
source of &ldquo;Why man had an unresolvable case&rdquo; and why so many human
conditions would not stay resolved.</p>
<p>To make a series of long sessions short, I was able to locate the
source of the incredibly long time bitter upset between ourselves and
the &ldquo;Evil Beings.&rdquo; Magic occurred!  The rage, the false rightness, the
trapped life force particles, the stuck holographic justifications and
the massive amounts of pain, hate and charge dissipated and the
reasons to continue the war between us also dissipated.</p>
<p>There were no more active war mongering evil beings on either
side.</p>
<p>Just trillions of subdued reactionary beings who had refused to
be responsible for past acts.</p>
<p>These subdued reactionary beings were and are still involuntarily
replicating the old programs and evil identities that were laid in by
the original evil beings.</p>
<p>I have covered much of this data in the book Gods in Disguise,
and the lectures on the Prime Source Axiom &ldquo;Codes&rdquo; course.</p>

<p>It means that those who are willing to use their psychic powers
to do the greatest good will be allowed to achieve their highest
dreams and creations, and will recover all of their subdued, lost or
oppressed Super Being godlike abilities.</p>
<p>It means immense change throughout the planet.</p>
<p>The natural spiritual nature of man will push through and become
the dominant force in education, business, relationships, religion,
science, medicine and the human potential movement.</p>
<p>Do not expect this to be an easy period of human history; there
will be enormous upheavals in business, religion, environments and
governments.  The old powers will fight to maintain their positions,
desperate to hide their betrayals of mankind.  Old paradigms will
slowly disintegrate.</p>
<p>New spiritually based paradigms will be the order of the day.</p>
<p>Processors will be the highest and most sought after careers, and
a processor will become the new executive, the new type of leader.</p>
<p>War, insanity, criminality, violence, illiteracy, domination,
subjugation and injustice will all be things of the past, for all will
be eliminated.</p>
<p>New spiritually based leaders will take the planet to a
transformational level of harmony and truth.</p>
<p>New nations will emerge, old groups will recover the lands and
cultures stolen from them.  There will be a lessening of tension as
the awareness levels and levels of intelligence rise to new heights.</p>
<p>As the spiritual skills and psychic abilities are recovered by
the people, the planet will enter the golden age which over time will
spread throughout the universes.</p>

<p>For these events and transformations to occur and the Golden Age
to come into being depends entirely on YOU.</p>
<p>How long it will take depends on how quickly YOU go into action
and eradicate your pain, charge, dishonesties, subject illiteracies,
misownerships, misidentifications and restraining, destructive,
sabotaging identities, and help others achieve the same results.</p>
<p>At the same time you will recover your and your spiritual
teammate&rsquo;s knowledge, processing skills and spiritual abilities to
transform others to their full Super Being potentials.</p>
