<p>Subject: BPC List</p>
<p>From: ACW</p>
<h2 id="the-freedom-from-being-taken-over-by-destructive-outside-forces-commanding-and-control-devices-procedure">THE FREEDOM FROM BEING TAKEN OVER BY DESTRUCTIVE OUTSIDE FORCES&rsquo; COMMANDING AND CONTROL DEVICES PROCEDURE<a class="headerlink" href="#the-freedom-from-being-taken-over-by-destructive-outside-forces-commanding-and-control-devices-procedure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>(Processing Booby-Trap Locator)</p>
<p>These devices are such things as brainwashings to fail, false
goals, false identities, false dreams, false perceptions, false
intentions, false images, false plans, false incidents, false times,
false locations, false reasons, false actions, false completions, false
products, false relationships, false people, etc.</p>
<p>They booby-trap processing, success, awareness, prosperity, memory,
happiness, and being spiritual.  They turn love into hate.  They destroy
your dreams.</p>
<p>These outside forces commanding control devices are laid in below
the consciousness level of the being.  </p>
<p>I have discovered that many previous practices have existed down
through the ages and that many of these previous practices employed
booby-trap technology against anyone who could threaten or be in
disagreement with them.</p>
<p>These booby-traps have been designed to activate any time the
Client experiences a major spiritual release (big blowout), or any time
the Client begins to succeed.</p>
<p>These previous practices have a common theme: they are &ldquo;the only
ones&rdquo; who have the knowledge, the answers, the secrets, the best way,
the only way.  They all profess allegiance to an &ldquo;Only One Deity;&rdquo; they
maintain DOMINANCE over their subjects.</p>
<p>Should they be challenged in any way, they will seek to subjugate
those whom they perceive to be a threat or opponent.</p>
<p>These practices are lower harmonics of the Evil Being Universe.</p>
<p>What really differentiates these practices is their destructiveness
toward their supposed perceived enemies.</p>
<p>The basic reason you have run afoul of these evil groups,
religions, therapies, governments, or philosophies is that you appeared
to be a threat to them, or you challenged their paradigms and control
and committed harmful acts against their personae.</p>
<p>You might have been a writer, an actor, a businessman, an
entrepreneur, an atheist, a believer, a superstar performer, a superstar
investor, an artist, a powerful leader, a newspaper reporter, a
politician, a rock star, a religionist, a Christian, a rich person, a
landowner, a party leader, or any perceived powerful threat to those in
power.  Often, these groups were riddled with corrupt personnel who
sought out people of substance and wealth and destroyed them, stealing
everything they owned, including their souls, minds, and visions, and
especially their beautiful or handsome partners.</p>
<p>So deadly have their mind technologies and their hatred of
spiritual awareness been that they have sought to totally destroy and
annihilate any abilities, awareness, or concepts of you as a spiritual
being, and they have successfully programmed millions, if not billions,
into unawareness and denial of self as the soul or spirit in charge of
their minds and bodies.</p>
<p><em>Definitions:</em></p>
<p>PROGRAM: n.  A list of procedures; schedule.</p>
<p>INCIDENT: n.  An occurrence; event.  An occurrence or event likely
to cause a crisis.</p>
<p>PROGRAM INCIDENT: Violent pain or drug-induced trauma; imprisonment
where behavior modification and conformity sets of pictures, sets of
images, and sets of commands are laid in unknowingly against the will of
the individual, designed to cause the individual to self-destruct should
they begin to become aware and uncontrollable by the powers that be.</p>
<h2 id="example-program">EXAMPLE PROGRAM<a class="headerlink" href="#example-program" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The following is a mind and vision control program done by an evil
cult that believed it had the technology of freedom:</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>Nicotine</p>
<p>Docilite</p>
<p>STUPIDITY BOMB Emperica</p>
<p>Purpose:  To deny thinking   Nightmarins</p>
<p>or planning.  To disconnect  Inhibitings</p>
<p>the spirit from the mind and Electric shocks interspersed</p>
<p>put in false and disruptive  with pictures and 3-D images.</p>
<p>programs to act through the body.</p>
<p><em>Definitions:</em></p>
<p>DOCILITE: A drug designed to make you docile, apathetic, tired,
lethargic and easily managed (such as Valium, sleeping pills,
soporifics, Mellaril, Navane, Thorazene, Trilafon, Haldol, and Prozac).</p>
<p>EMPERICA: A drug designed to make you feel like an emperor, King of
the World, God, the only one who knows anything or who can be trusted.
A manic state.  (Cocaine, Heroin, Crack, Ecstasy, LSD, PCP, Angel Dust).</p>
<p>NIGHTMARINS: Causes heavy blackness and unconsciousness during
which subliminal violent acts are committed on prisoner; perfect for
putting in unknown destructive command phrases and identities.  (Ether,
scopolamine, sodium Pentothal, chloroform, morphine, Atropine,
cyclopropane, Ethylene, Avertine).</p>
<p>This is a layered program that is designed to implant
hundreds-of-thousands of intentions, visions, and pictures encysted with
pain and confusions, all slightly different, with the intention of
causing a balled-up, immobilizing, painful, inability to act or think.</p>
<p>This program is layered in over a period of time; each series is
called a &ldquo;set.&rdquo; Each set creates a series of problems, then provides a
drug and action solution.  The intention is to use your own power to
totally immobilize you and your paradigm machinery and destroy any
desire to want or be anyone or anything.  You end up soulless and
godless.</p>
<p>Anyone who thought differently from the powers that be, or were
criminals were targets for this program.</p>
<p>To make sure that these implants and programs are never unlocked
and vanished, all types of therapists are portrayed as evil villains; as
secret destroyers of you.</p>
<p>Also implanted are visuals of you being a serial killer and rapist
of therapists, thus you must not be found out.</p>
<p>False harmful acts are a great way to cause you to restrain and
keep yourself and your past hidden.</p>
<p>Outside of the physical universe, these program incidents can be an
enforced reality done by telepathic imagery, with the being captured and
held in place by tractor beams and presser beams, and can often contain
blanketing, blackness, and invisibility.</p>
<p>They can stem from multiple beings projecting their images with
great force as a constant barrage into the being&rsquo;s universe in such
great volume that the being can no longer work out which images are his
and which are those of others!</p>
<p>This sends the being into a constant introspection of self, trying
to unlock the massive puzzle of &ldquo;Who am I; what am I; where am I; when
am I; why am I; how am I; what are my intentions; what are my images;
what are my moods; what is my mind; what are my motions; what are my
outcomes, and what are my consequences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These types of psychic implants leave the being constantly in
doubt, uncertain, unable to hold a position, and destroys its ability to
create and have space, time, energy, and objects.</p>
<p>These vicious implants create very destructive YOUICCIs (Your
Obsessive, Unknowing, Involuntarily-Created Commanding Identities that
are extremely difficult to find and handle because they pose an enormous
threat to your present identity and its life and livingness.</p>
<p>In discovering whether you have been a victim of these evil
technologists, you will notice that you have non-sequential daydreams of
being a great writer, or film star, or business tycoon, yet you never
implement those daydreams.</p>
<p>These are memories of former greatness pushing through, but they
also trigger the destructive YOU MUST NOT BE programs that have been
implanted to control, dominate, or subjugate you.  Added to this, you
have created YOUICCIs that have cemented you into degraded denial of
past or present small game playing, inconsequential identities.</p>
<p>As you rise up the Chart of Ascension, you will begin to hit into
identities that you must not be; identities that have been booby-trapped
by past evil groups that have decided you must be kept small.</p>
<p>I have been aware of this destructive, evil programming for a long
time but didn&rsquo;t realize the extent of it, or the secrecy and the power
of the denials and the destructiveness of the commands, nor the damage
that the occlusion caused to your control of your paradigms or life.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was the way in which these evil programs were
kept secret and held in place, and that they did not show up in the
course of standard processing and training.  They were meant to not be
discovered.  The Evil Technologists were well aware that someone in the
future would discover how to unlock people&rsquo;s potential but they have
done their damnedest to make sure their destructive programs stay hidden
and locked up.  They even have destructive programs laid in to counter
any processing techniques that could undo them; programs so designed
that any near-miss will access and put into play automatic
self-destructs and opposition-to-help paradigms that will drive you away
from those who have helped or befriended you.</p>
<p>The biggest trigger is the big blowout phenomenon, or the leaving
of the body (out-of-body experience), death, or near-death of a body.
These freedom of spirit experiences trigger the blackness, occlusion,
and denials of who or what you are.  Nor can you envision AND MAINTAIN NEW FUTURES.</p>
<p>You are dealing with massive betrayals of trust when you collide
with implants.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you or your client have triggered one of these
evil programs, you need to do the following steps on the ABL.</p>
<p>It should be noted that an implant is a very upsetting,
paradigm-crashing incident.  The ABL may not read well, or the being is
so upset that the ABL will not manifest at all.  You can observe the
client looking sad, grim, or very solid.  If you run into this
phenomenon, you will have to use the attention and interest of the
client to guide you.</p>
<p>If there is no manifestation on the ABL when you ask the client the
question, you ask, &ldquo;Do you have anything on that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Invite the client to look and communicate what is there.  Do not
hassle the client in any way.  As the incident breaks up and the force
dissipates, more and more parts of the implant will come to view.</p>
<p>Never, never, never make the client wrong for not being able to see
what is there.</p>
<p>You must be aware that this implant may have ruined your client&rsquo;s
future for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>It takes very kind, gentle work with handling to unlock and
dissipate implants.  Any roughness, make wrong, or accusation will cause
the client to misidentify the processor as an implanter.  This violates
the safety of the session and the client will be stuck in the implant,
fighting the implanter - you - and the technology.</p>
<p>Work with the client and keep them informed as to what is going on.
Do not lie or pretend, or the client will distrust you.</p>
<p>You must keep in mind also that you are looking for WHAT HAS ACCESSED THE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAM, NOT THE PROGRAM.</p>
<p>Program incidents cause the client&rsquo;s universe to collapse inward.
Consequently the client gets buried by his mind, identities and
environment.
Quite often there is so much force, confusion, stupidity, and
misownership connected to these program incidents that the meter will
not manifest properly.  Often you will get a gradual speeded rising of
the resistance value.  Thus, the best method of handling these questions
is by slow, two way assessment.  That is, you ask the question and let
the client look and answer the question.  The meter will start to
manifest as they answer.</p>

<p>We are a practice.</p>
<p>We seek recovery of the being a prime target of opposition fromimplanters.</p>
<p>We seek and find truths all implants are opposed to this.</p>
<p>We seek, find, and recover more knowledge the true enemy of
implanters.  All implants seek to not be found out; to stay unknown and
in control.</p>
<p>We produce huge wins the prime trigger to activate implants and
bring you back down.</p>
<p>We seek and recover cause and awareness also contrary to implant
programming, as they seek conformity and unawareness.</p>
<p>It is vital, therefore, that we de-access ourselves then dissipate
all implants that are dedicated to booby-trapping and preventing us from
attaining our dreams, subject masteries, and products.</p>
<h2 id="step-one-locating-triggers">STEP ONE: LOCATING TRIGGERS<a class="headerlink" href="#step-one-locating-triggers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is a vital step and must be done very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Take each question and engage in a two-way discussion on how the
client views and feel toward the subject.  All de-access actions apply
if any this lifetime areas contain low mood levels, upsets, or
criticisms.  Treat the subject as an incident.</p>
<p>Get the complete history of each area.  For example:</p>
<h2 id="history-step">HISTORY STEP<a class="headerlink" href="#history-step" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tell me about your understanding of The Institute of Applied
Knowledge.<br />
Client answers.  Processor acknowledges, then asks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did you first come in contact with (practice)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did it go?  Handle any upsets, criticisms, lies, or effectindicators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who did you come in contact with?  Get all whos, then ask:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you feel about (each who)?  Handle any upsets, negative
processing, criticisms, or effect indicators.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Just prior to your coming into contact with (practice), what
was going on in your life?  Handle all effect indicators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you locate the exact triggers.</p>
<p>This STEP ONE can be run on any practice that the client has been
heavily engaged in and can include diets, exercise, religion, cults,
drugs, yoga, meditation, vegetarianism, breatharianism, alcoholism,
medical, chiropractic, sexual, psychology, EST, Scientology, avatar,
athletics, exercise, etc., but you must always handle Institute of
Applied Knowledge, Advanced Leadership Center, Paradigm Technologies or
Power Leadership practices first, as the client may well have
superimposed the past practice on our practice.</p>
<p>You can produce amazing recoveries and huge wins when you do this,
as you can recover all past knowledge, cognitions, and abilities.</p>
<p>The following key areas must be de-accessed, then de-implanted:</p>
<p>a.  Your name for this practice: (Institute of Applied Knowledge,
Advanced Leadership Center, Paradigm Technologies, etc.)</p>
<p>(In your own words, what does this practice represent to you?)</p>
<p>b.  Making or getting self better</p>
<p>c.  Processing</p>
<p>d.  Processors</p>
<p>e.  Training</p>
<p>f.  Studying</p>
<p>g.  Being taught</p>
<p>h.  Wearing your hat</p>
<p>i.  Getting role educated</p>
<p>j.  Attaining Mastery</p>

<h2 id="step-two-locating-actual-practice">STEP TWO.  LOCATING ACTUAL PRACTICE<a class="headerlink" href="#step-two-locating-actual-practice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Take practice that made Client high and ask the following (you may
have trouble finding the actual practice; the Client may put down a drug
[example: LSD]).  After doing the number of times, you then ask:</p>

<h2 id="step-three-assessment">STEP THREE.  ASSESSMENT<a class="headerlink" href="#step-three-assessment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>

<p>It should be noted that as the client runs &ldquo;An implanter,&rdquo; a great
number of this life dones and restraints should come up, as the client
has most likely involuntarily replicated parts of the implant into this
life.  If there is very little mention of this life, yet you get Cause
Indicators, run Questions 3 - 8 repetitively, using before each
question, the phrase:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this lifetime, what.  .  .  .  .  ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This should be repeated on STEPS ELEVEN, TWELVE and THIRTEEN.</p>
<p>Many clients dive back in time so that they do not have to confront
this life and what they have done and restrained.  You must not let them
get away with this.</p>

<p>I realize that this procedure appears very long, but it will
dissipate completely these vicious evil programs very easily.  Two or
three times through these assessments, the evil programs will begin to
dissipate on inspection.  This rundown will uncover the most degraded
and destructive YOUICCIs and Free Radical Identities.  More, it may well
extend the longevity of your body.</p>
<p>These evil programs are designed to destroy the spirit&rsquo;s control
over their minds and bodies by destroying their ability to envision.
Worse, when they begin to envision, these evil programs are triggered
automatically, keeping the Client constantly over-accessed.</p>
