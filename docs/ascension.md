Ascension Experiences are the most important phenomena to handle
on a case.  

An Ascension Experience is that time you felt huge.

You have a massive presence.  Everything went right, you were a
GOD.

It is a massive, exciting high.  This is the F/N to end all
F/N's, Not only is your T/A floating but so are you.  You know ALL.
Can DO ALL.  Can BE ANYTHING OR ANYONE.

Your mood level is at the top of all scales.  Your cognitions go
on for days.

Yet the Ascension Experience phenomena is the most often
overlooked.

There are many reasons for this.

1.  The AE is beyond the auditors reality and technical case
handling repetoire of skills levels.

2.  There are often uncharted, unmapped areas of case.

3.  The inablity of the auditor to maintain control of the
session is at risk.(Big Scio auditor problem.)

4.  The AE state is a holographic creation or holographic
mock-up.  Thus is not part of a mind or mental image factor.  (Running
a AE case on mental image tech is deadly as it forces the AE case to
have to put a substitute mental image picture case there.

5.  An AE case always is a PT case.  That is they are just
present, able to span enormous spacation.  The AE's case isone of
hugeness, thus the time track of the past, present, future is within
the Beings own spacation.

6.  The auditor must be able to match or be greater than the AE
and the pc.  Otherwise the auditor will end up collapsing the pcs
universe.  Trapping them into a psychic containment or container.
Very painfull.  Very out int.  Very difficult to undo.

7.  The auditor is totally unaware that AE's and AE phenomena
exists.

## HAVE YOU HAD AN ASCENSION EXPERIENCE?

Welcome to the exciting and wonderful adventure: the exploration
and discovery of your True Self.  Man's final frontier is Man himself.

Psychologists and psychiatrists estimate we are using a scant
one-to-five percent of our potential; that ninety-five to ninety-nine
percent is hidden from us.  If this hidden potential is not working
for us, then it may be working against us.  Can you imagine that
ninety-five to ninety-nine percent of our power is being misdirected
into restraining ourselves?

Have you ever taken drugs or alcohol and felt the inhibitors and
restraints dropping away?  Your personality flowed forth, you felt
witty, you felt good, you felt alive, you felt powerful (it is these
soaring feelings of wellness that lie behind addiction).  Yet when you
sobered up or came off the drugs, you sank back into your cocoon of
inhibitors and restraints.

The drugs or alcohol acted to create a mild-to-strong ascension
experience.

The problem with drugs and alcohol is that they stimulate you,
artificially, beyond your control.

Ascension means to rise up.  An ascension experience is a period
of time in which you rose to a higher state.

Seminars, workshops, therapy, accidents, near-death experiences,
violent trauma, a huge win, being 'born again,' the coming together of
knowledge, an awareness of self as a spiritual being, etc.; all are
phenomena that can cause a high.  That high is an ascension
experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the last thirty years there have been millions of people who
attended transformational types of seminars; most business training
contains some form of transformational technology.  Some of these have
created enormous ascension experiences.

The vast changes that are occurring globally at such an alarming
rate that most of us are feeling disestablished, are the result of the
cumulative effects of ascension experiences happening to millions of
people.  The downfall of communism was a global ascension experience.

An ascension experience causes the individual who experiences it
to feel huge.  His awareness expands tremendously.  Often, he realizes
he is just playing games and wearing disguises.  He realizes he is not
his body; that his body is just a tool used to maintain his disguises.

Frequently, one experiences the recovery of god-like abilities
and perceptions.  The ascension experience has allowed one to unlock
the immense powers hidden within.  Some individuals even realize they
are giants, gods of their own universes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When this type of ascension experience manifests, life undergoes
a tremendous change.  The ascension experience individual becomes a
knowledge-seeking fanatic; he is on a steep learning curve.  What was
once vitally important now seems ridiculous.  Often he finds himself
getting promotion after promotion.  He may well end up running the
whole show.

But an ascension experience is a two-edged sword.  At the same
time that positive powers are unleashed, so also are negative,
destructive powers.  Often, to suppress and restrain the negative,
destructive powers, the individual inhibits the positive ones.  Now he
is back where he started.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the greatest fears anyone has is that of being out of
control.  Having control of your powers is vital to feeling in control
of your universe.

I have counseled a vast number of people over the last
thirty-five years.  I have lost count of the number I have handled who
experienced areas of life going out of control, having sexual
promiscuity, drugs, alcohol, work, and financial problems.  All
stemmed from having had a big ascension experience that unleashed all
sorts of powers prior to the problem or obsession.

The basic problem is that an ascension experience without
knowledge and role education is somewhat like a runaway train: it may
or may not arrive at its destination, but it is almost sure to cause
some kind of destruction on its way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ANY UNCONTROLLED ASCENSION EXPERIENCE, WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND ROLE EDUCATION, AND WITH UNKNOWN, MISDIRECTED IMAGERY, IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR FUTURE SUCCESS, PROSPERITY, AND HAPPINESS.

## A CONTROLLED ASCENSION EXPERIENCE, EMPOWERED WITH KNOWLEDGE, ROLE EDUCATION, AND KNOWN PROJECTED POSITIVE IMAGERY, IS ESSENTIAL TO YOUR CAUSING AND HAVING FUTURE SUCCESS, PROSPERITY, AND HAPPINESS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THE ASCENSION EXPERIENCE DEADLY PHENOMENON

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Ascension Experience throws you upward into one of your higher
universes, which triggers automatic expellers and masking devices that
can crash and put into chaos and shambles your existence in present
time.

An Ascension Experience is a deadly phenomenon without the proper
role education and processing because you will have activated your
most powerful psychic and telepathic abilities to work against you.

The end product of the role education and processing is you fully
being you with full control over your psychic and telepathic
abilities, your ability to love restored fully, you owning and
controlling your own universe, and you with the skills, knowledges and
abilities to help others achieve their ascension states.

## WHAT IS AN INVOLUNTARY REPLICATION?

It has taken thirty-five years of constant research and discovery
to find what lies behind most of man's unwanted conditions and
situations.

_Definitions:_

INVOLUNTARY: adj.  1.  Not performed willingly.  2.  Not subject
to control.

REPLICATION: n.  1.  A copy or reproduction.  2.  The act or
process of duplicating or reproducing something.

INVOLUNTARY REPLICATION: n.  The unwilling and out of control,
automatic, three-dimensional, holographic reproduction of an event,
identity, solution, or unwanted condition of some portion of a
spiritual being's past being replicated recently, existing in the
present, and continuing to exist in the future.

By three-dimensional holograph, we mean a full-scale mock up or
creation with all perceptics, full color, motion, emotion,
interactions, reactions, density, energy consumed or generated, space
it will occupy, time it will persist, and object and forms it or they
will take.  This also includes the opposing color, opposing motion,
opposing emotion, opposing interactions, opposing reactions, opposing
densities, opposing energy consumed or generated, opposing space it
occupies, opposing time it will persist, and opposing objects and
forms it or they will take.

When you are affected by an Ascension Experience, what takes
place is, you move into a higher self.  In most cases you move into a
state of MASTERFULNESS.  This state is very empowering.  It is a time
that, as a spiritual being, you occupied much more space than just
your body.  An awareness of yourself as having a position of
masterfulness with god-like abilities and having tremendous spiritual
powers.

This is where the trouble begins, for as well as unlocking the
god-like powers within you, you also unlock the negative side of your
powers.  This is the two-edged sword effect of empowerment and
ascension.

It is this two-edged sword effect that has booby-trapped all
empowerment and ascension transformational practices.

In most cases, when an Ascension Experience takes place, your
life will take on almost miraculous qualities and you will find that
your dreams become actualities.  But a dark side will also begin to
manifest.  Sudden losses or overwhelming problems begin to appear.
Partnerships become destructive.  Marriage problems seem to intensify,
often leading to divorce.

What has happened?

At the same time that you empowered your dreams, you also
involuntarily empowered your nightmares.

For example: You may be out with friends drinking and having a
good time.  Suddenly you experience a massive high (Ascension
Experience).  You're out of your body, your personality and wit are
brilliant.  The evening is magic.

To reexperience that high it is necessary to mentally replicate,
in three-dimensional form, the same set of circumstances and cause it
to manifest in the physical universe so that the drinking, the
spending money, the late night with your friends will again produce a
massive high.  This is repeated over and over again until you decide
you are spending too much money.  But you now have an uncontrollable
urge to drink.'

Now you cannot stop drinking.  That is an involuntary
replication.

Another example: You are madly in love with someone and they tell
you that they have found a new love.  You are in shock.  You are
overwhelmed.  Your heart is broken.  You cannot stop thinking about
what happened.  You are stuck in an involuntary replication of loss
and destruction of your dreams and aspirations.  Additionally, it may
trigger earlier losses and heartbreaks, which intensifies the present
time involuntary replication.

Another example: Your father was an alcoholic, abusive type of
person with a violent temper.  You vowed to yourself you would never
have anything to do with that type of person.  Yet somehow you always
end up with that type of person in your life.  That is an involuntary
replication.

All unwanted life situations stem from involuntary replications.
When your life is not working, there are involuntary replications.

You have involuntary replications if you suffer from:

Procrastination

Low mood level

Can't handle time

Can't handle money

Success reluctance

Closing reluctance

Income reluctance

Organizing reluctance

Happiness reluctance

Planning reluctance

Wealth reluctance

Trust reluctance

Relationship reluctance

Fear of failure

Fear of making a fool of yourself

Making the important unimportant

Making the unimportant important

Fear

Can't concentrate or focus

etc.

All the above stem from involuntary replications that are sapping
and misdirecting your power.

Behind all involuntary replications are Ascension Experiences.

## THE INVOLUNTARY REPLICATION DESTRUCTIVE PHENOMENA

The basic destructive problem that lies inherent in an
involuntary replication is that it creates, unknowingly to you, a
telepathic projector of negative images that compulsively attract
unknown and hidden others who have similar or identical negative
images.  These similar or identical negative images then compulsively
and obsessively fuse together with your negative images and create
massive negative agreements that become physical universe realities.

The destructive activity of an involuntary replication is a
guarantee of failure, poverty, and unhappiness.

Elimination of involuntary replications is a guarantee of
success, prosperity, and happiness.
