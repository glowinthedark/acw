Dear Greenzoners,

This the second time we have composed this e-mail.  AOL seem to have a bad
habit of disconnecting service at the most undesirable times..  I really
must get a new service provider. 

I would like to introduce you to Andrea.  She is the client I am working
with that is handling her (former) addiction to Crack

Heeerrrreees Andrea!! 

Hi everyone,

It is undescribable how I am feeling.  But, It's real!!  I have now ten
days clean of Crack. 

This is hard putting together the second letter.  The first one was really
a good one!! 

Marlene was my Guardian Angel here at the right place at the right time. 

My relationships with my children is growing day by day.  I thought it
could never happen.  I am dealing with things that should have been dealt
with a long time ago. 

I have tried treatment centers but, did not accomplish what I have
accomplished now thanks to this processing. 

My desire for the crack has vanished at this time. 

I am finding myself for the first time in twenty-eight years. 

I will keep you updated as to my progress

Knowing that poeple like you care gives me inspiration of wanting to
remain clean! 

I have a way to go, but I am heading in the right direction. 

Love,

Andrea
