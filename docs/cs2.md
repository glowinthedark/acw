## CLEAN SLATE PROCESS II â€” MISREPRESENTED IDENTITY OR OBJECT HANDLING STEPS

---

This process is run on a person to clean up any past dirty slates that
another person, place or thing has triggered.  It should be done as the
first action when two people start working together on exercises or
processing.

If they're going to do exercises they should run "On You" steps on each
other, then do the Clean Slate Handling on the exercise material, then
do the exercise.  If they're going to process, the processor would run
"On You" steps on the client as the first action of the first session.

When studying a subject the Clean Slate Handling Steps are done on any
related materials.  Then the "On a Person," "On People," or "On Places
or Things" steps should be run on all people, places or things related
to the subject, or connected to studying the subject.

## STEPS

On You:

1.   "Perceive me.  Does this trigger any memories of anyone?"

Acknowledge his answer.

a.  "Who was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

b.  "When was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

c.  "Where was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

d.  "Tell me about it."

Acknowledge his answer.

2.   "Perceive me.  What am I?"

Acknowledge his answer.

3.   "Perceive me.  Who am I?"

Acknowledge his answer.

Repeat questions 1 through 3 until the process ceases to trigger

the memories of anyone else and the person is in a higher mood.

On a Person:

1.   "Perceive (named person).  Does he/she trigger any memories of

anyone?"

Acknowledge his answer.

a.  "Who was that?"
Acknowledge his answer.

b.  "When was that?"
Acknowledge his answer.

c.  "Where was that?"
Acknowledge his answer.

d.  "Tell me about it."
Acknowledge his answer.

2.   "Perceive (named person).

What is he/she?"

Acknowledge his answer.

3.   "Perceive (named person).

Who is he/she?"

Acknowledge his answer.

Repeat questions 1 through 3 until the process ceases to trigger

the memories of anyone else and the person is in a higher mood.

On a Group of People:

1.   "Perceive them.

Do they trigger any memories of anyone?"

a.  "Who was that?"

Acknowledge each answer.

Get all whos.

b.  "When was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

c.  "Where was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

d.  "Tell me about it."

Acknowledge his answer.

2.   "Perceive them.

What are they?"

Acknowledge his answer.

3.   "Perceive them.

Who are they?"

Acknowledge his answer.

Repeat questions 1 through 3 until the process ceases to trigger

the memories of anyone else and the person is in a higher mood.

On Places or Things:

1.   "Perceive that (place/thing).

Does it trigger a memory of any place or thing?"

Acknowledge his answer.

a.  "What was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

b.  "When was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

c.  "Where was that?"

Acknowledge his answer.

d.  "Tell me about it."

Acknowledge his answer.

2.   "Perceive that (place/thing).

What is it?"

Acknowledge his answer.

3.   "Perceive that (place/thing).

Where is it?"

Acknowledge his answer.

Repeat questions 1 through 3 until the process ceases to trigger

the memories of anything or anywhere else and the person is in a

higher mood.

If at any time during this process the person comes up with a

precept, clear it with the Clean Slate Handling Steps, then return

to this process.

The end result of this process is the person actually perceiving

who or what he is perceiving when he is perceiving the who or

what.

These processes will produce a strong upsurge in the confidence

and certainty level of the person and will help stabilize his

ability to hold a position in the present.

These processes are based upon the Human Being Paradigm.
