Subject: BPC instruct

From: ACW

If you are sitting in a lot of BPC?

You can just assess the first list, find what "area item" appears to hold
the most interest.

Then lightly assess the next list.

Indicate the charged area.

The idea is to give you new view points to approach the area of charge.

You may or may not get the exact BPC.

But near enough is usually good enough to begin the unlocking process.

Under no circumstances force any item on yourself.

Often items will read and then it will be s/t else. The reason for this the
more BPC, the more lies.

It is best if taken to a win - break - win - break, etc.

Often it will just start unravelling.
