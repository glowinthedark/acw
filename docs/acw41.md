Noodle Tech! Huh?

Obviously to steep a gradient, gave you an instant PTP. "My TA is mostly
at 4.5 or above,"

Suggest you put aside the meter or allow yourself to have F/N's and a
high TA.

Just run:

What are willing to confront in PT?

What would you rather not confront in PT?

Run to a win. Forget about the meter.

If that is too difficult for you, you could run:

Spot an object in this room?

Name it?

What can you observe about it you like?

Repeat  over and over to a win.

I've used this noodle process for 35 years and usually go hugely
exterior after 5 or 6 commands.

Very good if you are a pro athelete or wanting to take a Casino apart
for some serious bucks.
