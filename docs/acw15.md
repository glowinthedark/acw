## AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOLDEN RULE

(It appears to be true in all cultures.)

Hinduism — This is the sum of duty: Do naught unto others which
would cause you pain if done to you.  (Mahabharata 5:1517)

Buddhism — Hurt not others in ways you yourself would find
hurtful.  (Udana-Varga 5:18)

Confucianism — Surely it is the maxim of loving kindness: Do not
unto others what you would not have them do unto you.  (Analects
15:23)

Taoism — Regard your neighbor's gain as your own gain and your
neighbor's loss as your own loss.

Zoroastrianism — That nature alone is good which refrains from
doing unto another whatsoever is not good for itself.
(Dadista-i-dinik 94:5)

Judaism — What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellowman.
That is the entire law; all the rest is commentary.  (Talmud, Shabbat
31a)

Christianity — All things whatsoever ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the Prophets.
(Matthew 7:12)

Islam — No one of you is a believer until he desires for his
brother that which he desires for himself.

## THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE VIRTUES AND PRINCIPLES OF KNOWLEDGISM

by Alan C. Walter

These virtues and principles have proven to be as valid in
Argentina, South Africa, India, Japan, and Europe as they are in the
United States and Canada.

They have demonstrated effectiveness for Hindus, Moslems, and
Buddhists, or any other religious or cultural group as they have for
Christians.

As the author of the materials and discoveries, I have now taught
our virtues, principles, and techniques to clients from almost all
countries of the known world.  Many of the presentations have been at
international conferences, so there were participants that came from
many nations, cultures, ethnicities, backgrounds, and philosophies.

At each conference, I observed that participants took ownership
of these virtues and principles as the fundamental causes for the
foundation to building a successful, prosperous, and happy life.

But what was more astounding to me was that they not only valued
these virtues and principles and took ownership, they almost all
stated, "I would like to acknowledge your refreshing new presentation
of these virtues and principles, as well as getting me to re-inspect
and re-evaluate the importances of what I have always known, but had
been making less of.  These virtues and principles have always been a
part of our culture, our philosophy, and what we value."

Participants from the following countries and their cultures
indicated where their virtues and principles were located:

England — Many of the participants claim these virtues and
principles are part of their school codes.

Malaysia — Participants stated that these teachings are found in
the Koran.

Morocco — Participants claim that these teachings are to be
found in all educated families.

Portugal — Several high-level executives stated, "We have always
realized these virtues and principles were of immense value, but your
material gave us a practical method of applying and living them."

Spain — "This was how our grandparents used to act."

Greece — "The great philosophers Aristotle, Socrates, and Plato
all taught us these basic, workable virtues and principles."

Japan — Participants recognized these virtues and principles as
also belonging to the teachings of Buddha and the Bushido code of the
Samurai.

China — Participants were well aware that the virtues and
principles taught were concepts contained within the teachings of
Confucius and Mencius.

Argentina — Participants were surprised at how many virtues and
principles we used that were part of their cultures.

Russia — Participants exclaimed that was why they had the
difficulties that were destroying so many of their cultures.  They had
gotten away from these virtues and principles, and that was how the
old Russia of eighty years ago believed.

India — Participants were amazed at how our material paralleled
the philosophies and wisdom contained in Hinduism, and how the
knowledge contained in the Bhagavad-Gita had been brought into the
21st century.

Philippines, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Venezuela — All
stated that their countries were all beginning to re-embrace these
virtues, principles, and teachings, and that deep down they have
always been a vital part of their cultures.

Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and the West Indies
-- All claimed that their cultures and nations were seeing a
re-embracing of these virtues, principles, and teachings and that
these are what were the basic foundations of their traditions and
character.

Europe — The participants from the many cultures and nations,
almost as one, announced that these virtues, principles, and teachings
are central to their philosophies and cultures.

None of this should really have been so astounding.  After all, I
have been a consultant, counselor, teacher, and interviewer of some of
the world's most successful, prosperous, powerful, and knowledgeable
leaders, executives, authors, athletes, and mentors for great
cultures, philosophies, nations, and individuals, both past and
present.

My key intentions were to get the true answers of these people to
the questions:

"What has worked consistently for you?

"What do you value the most?

"What is the most important virtue for happiness?"

After all, I was investigating the people from the most powerful
and enduring cultures and philosophies of the world.  That they all
shared the identical virtues and principles that were universal,
self-evident, and self-empowering concepts.  I would have been more
startled had they been different.

But the answer to what worked, what was the most valued, the most
important universally came down to one answer that towered over all
other answers.

That answer to what was the most workable, valuable, and
important virtue, principle, or attribute for others was HONESTY.

The participants agreed that:

Without honesty, there is no honor.

Without honesty, nothing or no one can be trusted or relied upon.

Without honesty, nothing or no one is worthy of power, reward,
respect.

Without honesty, there is no reason to exist, only to pretend.

Without honesty, there is no one to be friendly and close to,
only to be alone or distant.

Without honesty, a family is devoid of respect and honor.

Without honesty, you are not a person to be relied upon; you are
a fraud and to be suspect.

Without honesty, there is no freedom, just entrapment to your
lies.

Without honesty, there is no truth, only deception.

Without honesty, there is no decency, only indecency.

Without honesty, there is no pure knowledge, only false
knowledge.

Without honesty, there is no purity of spirit, only materialism.

Without honesty, there is no pure, true love, only
thinly-disguised hate and resentment.

Without honesty, there is no pure integrity, only disintegration
and individuation.

Without honesty, there is no pure Mastery, only incompetence.

Without honesty, there is no pure Trust, only distrust.

Without honesty, there is no pure Pleasure, only pain.

Without honesty, there is no pure Happiness, only depression.

What impressed me most about the tens of thousands of people who
have answered the above questions is not that they were Japanese,
Chinese, Indians, or Americans; they were specific individuals that
had the same basic values, dreams, aspirations, and visions about life
and the future as we did.

If we could increase the honesty level of people, we could be a
force for good; and if we could get others to help others to regain
their honesty, then we would transcend all religions, philosophies,
nationalities, and cultures and make this a much better world.
