Duplicate what you are observing as much as is comfortable.

These type of processes act as a gradient, so as the significance's or
charge connected to the objects dissolve, the actual tends to become
self evident.

As well as "confront" you can use "responsibility" "like" "agree with"
"go into communication with" "reach for." Over time these processes act
as OT processes as they expand a beings spacation.

I've used them over the years when I could feel myself out of PT.

I have always had a tendency to dive out of PT, down the track,
partially because I have been a major PT target.
