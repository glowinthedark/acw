"So God created man in his own image."

Genesis 1:27

King James Bible

To understand one's self it is important to understand God.

God is a spiritual being with infinite attributes.

Some of these infinite attributes are:

## KNOWLEDGE

>			IMMORTALITY			POWER
>
>			RESPONSIBILITY			SURVIVAL
>
>			INTEGRITY			FRIENDLINESS
>
>			LEADERSHIP			WISDOM
>
>			HONESTY				JUDGMENT
>
>			LOVE				JUSTICE
>
>			HARMONY				GOODNESS

## TRUTH

"Image," by definition (a duplication of, a perfect copy, a reflection),
means that man is basically a Spiritual Being that has the potential for:

## KNOWLEDGE

>			IMMORTALITY			POWER
>
>			RESPONSIBILITY			SURVIVAL
>
>			INTEGRITY			FRIENDLINESS
>
>			LEADERSHIP			WISDOM
>
>			HONESTY				JUDGMENT
>
>			LOVE				JUSTICE
>
>			HARMONY				GOODNESS

## TRUTH

To be closer to God, it is necessary to duplicate those qualities that God has.

Failure to duplicate God's attributes is the basis of sin.

By degrading one's self and one's potentials, one is moving away from God.

By improving one's self and one's potentials, one is able to come closer to
God.

As one duplicates God's attributes, one finds that the Spiritual Power
within oneself begins to flow forth.
