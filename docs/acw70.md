The MCG is the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The largest stadium in Australia.
It is where the 1956 Olympic Games were held.

There were several.

The present time physical universe game or box is: Multiple paths and
practices out.

To achieve caselessness in any box requires being able to optimize all
identities and objects in the box.

All boxes contain prime identities. Each of these prime identities need to
be taken to mastery. This requires a lot of hatting and is a form of create
processing as it puts more there. Destroy processing erases and takes away
what's there.

i.e.. Business: Have a Leader, Execs, Marketers, Sales, White Collar
workers, Blue Collar workers, Beginners, Students or trainees, etc.

Leaders, executives, marketers and sales create the future and continuously
puts the future there for the business. People who cannot effectively master
these hats have no chance of achieving caselessness on their PU boxes.

When you observe someone ranting and raving about sales, management,
marketing, finances or leadership you are observing someone who cannot
create and put PU futures there. Worse seek to destroy the future.

In the old days there was a process named "Parts of Existence."

The key question was: What is part of your PT existence?

You would list ALL the items.

Taking each one using interest or read and put the rudiments in on it.

Special notice was taken of items that should have been on the list but were
not.

By running this process it was possible to reach a state of caselessness on
ones PT box.

This process was later superseded by 3-2H.
