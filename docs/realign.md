_ACW:_

The auditor was running The Life Realignment R/D. (It is what we use for
Upset Handling or ARC breaks.)

The only question she recalled was:

Connected to (husband) wanting to leave you, was there a shock?

She ran the rest of the R/D she just informed me.

## THE LIFE REALIGNMENT SEQUENCE

Prior to doing this process for the first time you must check: 

"How do you feel about getting better?"

Handle any negative processes that come up.  First, handle negative
processes the person is running on himself with Self Sabotage Handling.
Then use this sequence to handle any negative processes others have run on
him.  Then proceed with using this process to handle all other upsets and
disharmonies that the person has.

0.	While doing these steps, periodically check for kepts with: 

"In this session ...."

"... have you thought of something you didn't tell me?"   or 

"... did you think of something you're holding back?"   or 

"... did something come up that you wouldn't want me to know about?"   or 

"... did something embarrassing come to mind?"    

Always get kepts (W/H's) no matter when in the session or the client's
existence, as they come up.

1a.	Ask:  "Is there an Upset or Disharmony?"

If there is no upset or disharmony, proceed to the next process advised for
the client.  If there is an upset...

b.	Find out what the upset or disharmony is about with: 

"Tell me about the upset or disharmony."

c.	Find out "who" or "what" the upset or disharmony is with.

2a.	Ask:  "What process did (who/what) run on you?"

b.	Ask:  "How did he/she/they/it do that?"

3a.	Ask:  "Is there a moment of shock?" 

If there is no shock, continue with Negative Process Handling from step #6
onward.  If there is a shock ...

b.	Ask:  "Where did the shock occur?"

c.	Ask:  "When did the shock occur?"

Have the person spot exactly where and when the shock occurred; ie. "At the
kitchen table in my Beverly Hills home at 10:30 Saturday morning on the 5th
of July 1987."  If necessary, guide the person until the exact where and
when have been spotted.

d.	Ask:  "Where on your body did you experience the impact or feelings
connected to the shock?"

e.	Ask:  "What is the size of the shock?"

f.	Ask:  "What is the weight of the shock?"

g.	Ask:  "What is the color of the shock?"

h.	Ask:  "What is the duration of the shock?"

i.	Ask:  "What is the sensation of the shock?"

j.	Ask:  "What are the frozen moods or attitudes in the shock?"

k.	Ask:  "Were there any moods or attitudes you had to use to restrain
yourself or the shock?"

4a.	Ask:  "After the shock, what process or processes did you run on others
or things?"

b.	Find out "who" or "what" the others were.

5a.	Ask:  "After you ran your process on others or things, what process did
they run on another or others or things?"

b.	Find out "who or what" the another or others or things were.

6.	Ask:  "After the shock, what process or processes did you run on yourself?"

7.	Ask:  "During this time period, was there anything you must not experience?"

8a.	Ask:  "At the time of the upset or disharmony, did you have any
destructive, hostile, opposing or evil intentions or feelings towards
(who/what from 1c)?"

b.	Ask:  "What were they?"

Get a list of all destructive, hostile, opposing or evil intentions that the
client has towards "who/what".

9a.	Ask:  "At the time of the upset or disharmony, did you set about
undermining, sabotaging or causing chaos towards (who/what from 1c)?"

b.	Ask:  "What did you do?"

c.	Ask:  "What were the consequences?"

d.	Ask:  "What else did you do?"

e.	Ask:  "What were the consequences?"

f.	Repeat d & e to get all.

10a.	Ask:  "Prior to the shock, was there anything you didn't want
(who/what) to find out about?

b.	Ask:  "What was that?"

c.	Ask:  "When was that?"

d.	Ask:  "Where was that?"

e.	Say:  "Tell me all about it."

f.	Ask:  "What were the consequences of that?"

11.	Ask:  "Prior to the shock, what were your Dreams and Aspirations?"  Get
all of them.

12a.	Ask:  "Prior to the shock, how big were you when you had your Dreams
and Aspirations?"

b.	Ask:  "How big were you after the shock?"

Note:	If the client's mood or size drops when doing #12b, have him tell you
again how big he felt prior to the shock to regain his size.

13a.	Say:  "Move to the moment of shock."  When client is there...

b.	Say:  "Permeate the shock, fully experience it and have it dissipate into
free life force particles."  (with intention).

Note:	If client has trouble permeating it, locate the main mood or must not
experience item and run:  

a.	"From where could someone experience (mood/item)?" to Cause Indicators.

b.	"From where could someone create (mood/item)?" to Cause Indicators.  

Then check to see if the shock has blown, and if not have them permeate,
experience and dissipate it..

14a.	Ask:  "What vision of yourself or your environment was created from the
moment of shock onward?"

b.	Say:  "Tell me about it."  Make sure client scans forward to the present
relating what happened.

c.	Ask:  "How did you handle it?"

d.	Ask:  "What were the consequences?"  Get all of them.

15a.	Ask:  "At the time of the upset or disharmony, what did (who/what from
1c.) do that you didn’t like, couldn’t handle, or didn’t want to
experience?"  Get the exact action or doingness the client couldn’t confront
or handle.

b.	Ask:  "Have you ever (action/doingness)?"  If this manifests or the
client says yes, get what it was and handle with Harmful Acts Handling.

16.	Ask:  "At the time of the shock, what type of being or identity did you
become?"

Get the type of being or identity and run Handling Your Own and Others' Free
Radical Identities from question 3 onward.

17a.	Ask:  "Have you known (who/what from 1c.) before this life?"

Get client to look.  If "Yes," go to b.  If "No," ask:

"Do you have an earlier upset or disharmony with (who/what from 1c)?"

b.	Ask:  "When was that?"

c.	Say:  "Tell me about it."

d.	Ask:  "Was there an earlier time you knew (who/what)?"

e.	Sau:  "Tell me about it."

f.	Repeat d.and e. to the first time client knew (who/what).

g.	Ask:  "What process did the then (who/what) run on you?"

REPEAT steps 2b to 16  on the then who/what.

18.	Reorient the client to and do steps 3 to 17 on each "who" or "what" from
4b. and 5b.

The End Product of this process is the person being:

1.   Able to Live their Dream.

2.   Able to play much bigger games.

3.   Able to play with able, upgrade players.

4.   Able to play in mainstreams of life and planetary games.
