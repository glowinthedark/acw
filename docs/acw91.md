The meter is reading on the charge....the T/A is high or low, but often the
area is so charged the needle does not respond......so 
it looks like the meter is not reading. Then you have the state of the pc's
present time, the response to questions, the mood 
level. 

Simply put the pc is sitting in immense charge. Charge causes unreality.
The meter reads on what is real to the pc. 

This is common sense. 

The most common reason the pc makes no gains is that the session itself is
the restimulator. Something about the session or the 
session environment matches a past incident or PTP's of long duration.
After a few bad sessions the action of going in session 
will stop the needle from reading. 

Finding the charged item and getting enough charge off so it now reads is
quite a trick. 

What must be present is a safe environment. 

The processor must be capable of very light touch processing. 

The pc has to regain their confidence in their ability to spot correctly. 

The item found usually is a vast generality. 

You really can't assess as the meter is not reading.....yet you must
assess...... 

So you assess by pc's interest or reaction. 

First list: 

I want to check something? 

Life 

Sessions 

PC responds " I got a sinking feeling when you said sessions." 

i.e.: You make a simple PT list to do with sessions. 

Auditors 

Meter 

Room 

Processing 

Comm. Cycle 

Meter reads 

F/N's 

Acknowledgments. 

Missed Items 

Wrong processes. 

You call out each list item......this is done fairly slowly. a few seconds
pause between each item. 

Nothing reads. 

You ask the pc anything come to mind? 

PC....."Yeah when you said missed items.... I felt weird that strange
sinking feeling again." 

Still no reads on the meter. But some pc attention and interest. 

You cannot pull out a List Correction as the meter doesn't read and the pc
has probably been butchered with correction lists in 
the past. 

So you do simple incident running on Listing and finding items. 

When did you first run into trouble to do with missed items? 

If it is the correct area the pc will be able to run that track,
occasionally the meter will begin to read, but it will be very latent. 

As the Item finding disasters unfold, the meter will read more, but more
likely the List outnesses are sitting on top of other 
session by-passed charge. Or the pc says....Christ the missed item is AN
AUDITOR. At which point the pc will begin to 
unleash a barrage of hatred at Auditors. Then suddenly realize his dad is a
psych and he represented auditors and auditing. 
Yadda - yadda! 

You find the father broke every part of the auditors code, butchered the
comm cycle, chopped the itsa-maker line, and so did 
all the other therapists and so has the pc. 

It can take weeks or even years to undo. You take every session item the pc
has some response to. If it is not charged, the pc 
will look at it and happily tell you not charged. 

But undo it will. 

The meter will begin to read more. 

Meanwhile the pc's life and living will begin to improve. 

 > Surely one should not run every non reading item!

No, definitely not, but you can feel pc interest or fixated attention in
the correct area. The pc will tell you the area that needs to 
be run, their attention will be stuck in the area. 

I just recently made an audio tape on Handling Charge and By-passed Charge.
