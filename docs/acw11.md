As you can observe not very much, I found the general public could
answer the mood question where-as they tended to have difficulty with
emotion. Mood also will get the predisposition that set the unwilling to
experience mood into play.

Also the client puts attitudes and combinations of subjects or feelings
with mood. And if it is an unwilling to experience, it acts as a self
created stop, thus solidifying the area.

When you find an unwilling to experience item. (there are often several
in a very solid mass.)

Run: 

>From where could a (God, Godlike, Spiritual Being, Someone)
experience..(the unwilling to experience mood)? to a win.

Then run:  From where could a......create (the item)? To a win.

This combination will usually set the flows in motion and the MASS will
begin to disintergrate.
