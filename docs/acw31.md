## ROUGH DRAFT:

## PUTTING ORDER INTO CHAOS

The presence of By-Passed Charge means very simply there is an area of
chaos that is blocking the natural flows of energy between terminals.

The easiest way to handle By-Passed Charge is to do the handling as part
of the introduction to your subject.

The most chaos is usually encountered when a client or student begins
their first action.

On this planet at this time there is great chaos, dispersal and
unreality as to what the composite person is.

It is this chaos, dispersal and unreality that makes public
dissemination so painful for most practitioners. It also can be the
source of enormous By-Passed Charge.

I have found the best way to handle this is to set the client up ahead
of time by introducing them to who and what they are and what they are
not, by simple drills, exercises or processes that can be done at a low
cost, take as long as is needed, series of actions.

One of the most effective is the Distinction Exercise. This was taken
from a Depak Chopra process that helped many people put their cancer in
remission. My thought was if it was powerful enough to do that, it would
be very easy to put order into the chaos of a beings present time
existence using the same approach.

Surprisingly it worked very well. It is a superb successful indicator
and handling exercise for separating and becoming aware of areas of
By-Passed Charge.

The Instructor instant hats them on how to do it. Gently putting in more
and more order and reality as the students get some experience. Lots of
discussion and sharing of viewpoints.

A good instructor can groove in many of the basics and begin to help the
student become aware of the effective eductive communication cycle.

Taking plenty of time role educating students and clients on these
basics can save 100's of hours later. As they begin to win they become
aware and have certainty that the Green Zone Truth Phenomena is
attainable, not only on course but in life as well.. A further benefit is
they have a seamless non dangerous way to learning how to process
others.

By the way this Distinction Exercise will handle and run out the
By-Passed Charge accumulated from past traumatic training courses.

## DISTINCTION EXERCISE

_Definition:_

The purpose of this exercise is to distinguish the composite
parts
that create the identity or identities that you wear.

There are five distinct parts. These are:

1 — Spirit: You, the life force, the power, the strength, the

awareness, the knower, the perceiver, the intelligence.

2 — Vision: A spiritually created, three dimensional image
that is
telepathically projected into a future time and place which
establishes what you are working towards.

3 — Mind: A tool for recording the past, storing
remembrances,
retaining data and information, and the formulation of plans
and
strategies to create the future you envision.

4 — Body: An oxygen-carbon, chemically fed, machine used for
implementing the plans and strategies formulated by the mind
to
attain the future you envision. The body is clothed in a
uniform to
visually establish the identity.

5 — An Identity or Identities: The combination of
Spirit-Vision-Mind-Body knowingly or unknowingly directed and
activated by a purpose, knowledge, skills, plan and the
abilities to
implement that plan to attain an envisioned outcome.

## THE EXERCISE

Exercise Position — Have the student seated comfortably in a
chair, Coach sitting opposite with legs on either side of
Student's
legs, with a distance of about three feet between Coach and
Student.

This exercise must be administered in the mood level of spirit
of
play.

Step One:

Coach asks Student to close his eyes.

a — Coach then says:

"Just sit comfortably, appreciating whatever comes to view."
(pause)

"If something strong or even a gripping thought comes up just
let it go." (pause)

"You'll find that easy to do."

Coach pauses for 20 to 60 seconds to allow time for something
to happen.

b — Coach then asks:

"Did you feel any fear or anxiety or unpleasant sensation?"

Student answers.

If Student just answers "Yes," Coach says: "Tell me about it."

c — Coach acknowledges the Student's answer, then asks:

"From where could a spiritual being experience (named
unpleasant sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

"From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant
sensation)?"

This sequence a, b and c is repeated 4 or 5 times, or until
the Student is comfortable.

Step Two:

a — Coach says to Student:

"Close your eyes. Now I want you to observe that there are
spaces between your thoughts, like patches of blue between the clouds. When you notice such a space just give a nod."

Student does this and Coach acknowledges gently each nod.
Coach repeats this until Student is comfortable.

b — Coach then asks:

"Do you feel fear or anxiety or unpleasant sensation now?"

If Student doesn't then move to step three.

c — If Student does, Coach gets it named and runs:

"From where could a spiritual being experience (named
unpleasant sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

"From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

d — Then Coach commands Student: "Close your eyes and
continue to observe the space between your thoughts, and nod
when you do."

Coach acknowledges each nod and continues to do b, c, and d
until Student is comfortable.

Step Three:

While continuing to do step two, Coach asks the following
questions:

a — Coach asks: "Where is your body?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

b — Coach asks: "Where is your mind or thoughts?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

c — Coach asks: "Where is your vision?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

d — Coach asks: "Where are you in relation to your vision,
your mind or thoughts, and your body?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

"Is there an unpleasant sensation?"

If so, get it named and ask:

"From where could a spiritual being experience (named
unpleasant sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

"From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant
sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

Coach repeats Step Two and Step Three a-b-c-d several times
until Student is comfortable or has a big "Aha!".

e — Coach then asks: "Where is the identity you create by the

combination of you, your vision, your mind, and your body?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

f — Coach asks: "What are some of the abilities that you gave
to that identity?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

g — Coach asks: "What have been some of the consequences of
those abilities that you have given to that identity?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

h — Coach asks: "What are some of the liabilities you gave to
that identity?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

i — Coach asks: "What have been some of the consequences of
those liabilities that you have given to that identity?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

"Is there an unpleasant sensation?"

If so, get it named and ask:

"From where could a spiritual being experience (named
unpleasant sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

"From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant
sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

Coach repeats steps a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i until Student has major
Cause Indicators.

j — Coach then asks: "What telepathic image is it okay for
you to project?"

Student answers and Coach acknowledges.

"Is there an unpleasant sensation?"

If so, get it named and ask:

"From where could a spiritual being experience (named
unpleasant sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

"From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant
sensation)?"

Repeat until a rise in mood.

The end product of this exercise should be someone aware of
self spiritually, much more present and aware that they have
created their life the way it is, and that it follows the basic
paradigm of life.
