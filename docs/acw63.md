## EXERCISING YOUR SPIRITUAL POWERS

There are two basic abilities that each spiritual being has:

1.  The ability to perceive.

2.  The ability to create.

I have covered the ability to perceive in other bulletins.

The ability to create has been covered also, but not in depth.
Especially the phenomena of powerful three dimensional holographic
visions and the effects they create when they are introduced into an
environment.

Powerful three dimensional holographic visions are in themselves
massive disruptions to the automatic programs that most life and
living is being run on.

As I discussed in The Paradigm Matrix book the vision is the
software for the mind.

A powerful three dimensional holographic vision then is a
powerful piece of software that will if placed and handled properly
upgrade the current mind, body and action programs in place.

The ability to create a powerful three dimensional holographic
vision and implement it puts the creator into the realm of leadership.
It can also put the originator of the vision in the position to be
abusive, for if the vision is not wanted by others it is forcing an
unwanted want into their space.  That is abusive.

This realm of leadership requires a lot of know-how and
responsibility.

The question you have to ask yourself is:

## DO YOU WANT TO BE A POWERFUL LEADER WHO IS PROSPEROUS, SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY?

For most the answer is yes, to at least one of these states.  If
not yes to them all.

What is required to be a powerful leader who is prosperous,
successful and happy?

To be powerful requires having plenty of life force particles
available.

To lead one has to know the way and have the skills and the
resources to get there.

To be prosperous, successful and happy requires supplying what
others need and want and are willing to adequately exchange for.

Powerful leadership requires powerful three dimensional
holographic visions that are under your control and can be
telepathically projected in such a way that others can share your
vision and contribute to it and the vision also contributes to them.

A powerful three dimensional holographic vision has one liability
attached to it.  When you project it into the physical universe it
will occupy spaces that contain other beings creations.  Those other
beings tend to get somewhat upset at you usurping their space and
destroying their games and playing fields.

Another area that is vital if you are part of a team is for the
powerful three dimensional holographic vision to be in alignment with
your fellow teammates.  Especially those that are above you in the
organization.

What happens then is the powerful three dimensional holographic
vision accesses the owners of the other creations and game players.
They will fight back unless they can observe how your powerful three
dimensional holographic vision can help them play a better, more
prosperous, successful, and happier game.

Thus there are eight key factors that must be done to cause a
beings powerful three dimensional holographic vision to arrive and
become fully created in the Physical Universe.

1.  PRESENCE:

The powerful leader who projects the powerful three dimensional
holographic vision must continue to be present while the powerful
three dimensional holographic vision is being assimilated and fused.

2.  ABLE TO HOLD A CONSTANT, STABLE POSITION WITH THE VISION:

The powerful leader is capable of maintaining presence and
holding a constant, stable position with the vision in its full three
dimensional holographic created state.

3.  ABILITY TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE VISION:

In spite of life's and others constant distractions and
misdirection's the being is able to keep themselves and their life
force particles focused on the powerful three dimensional holographic
vision

4.  ABLE TO PROCESS THE BY-PASSED CHARGE, FORCE, AND MASS THAT IS ACTIVATED BY THE POWERFUL TELEPATHICALLY PROJECTED THREE DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAPHIC VISION:

The powerful leader who telepathically projects the powerful
three dimensional holographic vision must continue to be present and
must be willing and have the skills and the repertoire to process the
beings and themselves on the areas of by-passed charge, force, and
mass that can be activated and accessed by the powerful three
dimensional holographic vision that was created and projected.

5.  CONTINUING ATTENTION TO DETAILS AS THE POWERFUL TELEPATHICALLY PROJECTED THREE DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAPHIC VISION COMES INTO BEING AND MANIFEST ITS FORM IN THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE:

It also takes a lot of nurturing to bring a three dimensional
holographic vision into being and have it manifest itself in the
proper form that you want into the physical universe.

It is not unlike a farmer who envisions his crops for the year.
The vision is the easy part.  Now comes the plowing, the sowing, the
weeding, the maintenance, the reaping, the selling and the delivery of
the harvested crop to its final destination.

Add to the farmers problems, the quality of his farming skills,
his land, equipment, help, the weather, the market place, the need for
his crop, the pests, the cost of fertilizer, gasoline, etc.  and you
can easily observe it requires lots of resources and know-how for him
to be successful.

6.  ABILITY AND WILLING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL LINES AND PLAYERS THAT THE POWERFUL TELEPATHICALLY PROJECTED THREE DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAPHIC VISION COMES INTO CONTACT WITH:

This step is possibly the hardest step to do as not only those
below you need to be educated, but those above you must also be fully
educated and kept informed as to what is progressing.  Thus the
ability to communicate and control needs to be excellent.

7.  ABILITY TO PUT AND KEEP LINES IN:

All powerful telepathically projected three dimensional
holographic visions that manifest in the Physical Universe operate
best when they follow the linear time lines and sequential steps.
Thus each piece of the vision needs to be put on the correct time
lines and sequential steps.

8.  THE ABILITY TO TRAIN PEOPLE:

This is self evident as part of harmony of action is having the
people who can contribute and produce what is wanted.

9.  BEING ABLE TO ALIGN YOUR 3DH VISION WITH OTHERS 3DH VISIONS:

To create harmony and momentum it is vital that you also grant
beingness and recognition to others powerful telepathically projected
three dimensional holographic visions.

This creates a powerful team of beings that will help forward the
powerful telepathically projected three dimensional holographic
visions.

As you help others achieve their wants they will also help you
achieve your wants.
