## THE INTANGIBLES OF PROCESSING

Over the years, I have always been somewhat amazed how some
processors almost always get high quality results on their clients,
whilst other though running the same process only manage mediocre,
poor or no results.

The differences between each type of processor can be summed up
with having a masterful communication cycle that contain the quality
and excellence of the following three attributes and four intentions.

## THREE ATTRIBUTES:

1.  DYNAMIC PRESENCE.

2.  CARING.

3.  FRIENDLINESS.

## FOUR INTENTIONS:

1.  THE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE THE CLIENT WIN BIG.  (Helping the
client to be able to own more and more of itself, its own universe and
all aspects of the games they are playing.)

2.  THE WILLINGNESS TO KNOW ALL, AND TURN ON FULLY ALL THE FORCE AND CHARGE..

3.  THE WILLINGNESS TO PERMEATE ALL, PLUS TO HELP THE CLIENT AS NEEDED TO ERASE THE UNWANTED FORCE AND CHARGE.

4.  THE WILLINGNESS TO LET THE CLIENT HAVE FULL AND COMPLETE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN WINS.

## A COLLISION OF REALITIES

The first time I became aware of my lack of depth as a processor
was in March, 1963.  I was in England studying.  The Guru I was
studying under sent a message asking to see me in his office the
following afternoon, at 3.00 p.m.

His office was in a manor house, the office was very large, the
furnishings somewhat ordinary, nothing lavish, but of good quality.

Needless to say I was somewhat anxious about the meeting.  He
greeted me warmly and asked me to sit alongside of him at his desk.  I
noticed he didn't look to good, his eyes were surrounded by dark
circles, and when I spoke, he seemed to wince.

I asked him: “Are you all right?

He answered: “Well I've got this splitting headache.”

I asked: “When did it start?”

He answered: “Last night about an hour after Mary-Sue and I
finished session.”

“What happened?  I again questioned.

“Well I suppose it could have something to do with the session.”
He replied.

I had noticed a meter was on his desk, so I indicated to him
would he mind picking up the cans, he smiled and reach for the cans
and handed the meter over to me.

I said.  “Start of Session.” Quietly.

“Now tell me what happened?” The meter tone arm was at 4.7 and
the needle was stuck solid.

He told me he and Mary-Sue were doing some Goals-Problems-Mass
running and they had found a new truncated pair of items.  The meter
tone arm was still stuck at 4.7 and the needle was still stuck solid.

I asked, “Was there something not quite correct about the items?”

“Weeeeell” in that long drawl voice of his, “It kinda invalidates
the other set of items that we had found earlier.” - long pause -
“also it puts two different GPM goals into present time.” The meter
tone arm was still stuck at 4.7 and the needle was still stuck solid.

I was beginning to feel out of my depth, “what do I do now?”
Terror was beginning to gnaw at my stomach.  “Jeeeesus!” Why did I do
this?”

Suddenly he looks at me.  “Inwardly stark terror turns on!” “I'm
losing it big time.” I think.

He asks “what's the meter doing?” I tell him.  “Hmm!” then
silence.

“This is not going right!” I worry.

So I mumble: “Maybe you've hit into a glum area?” Recalling high
tone arm often means an area of problems surrounded by service facs.

“Huh!” he said contemptuously.  Definitely withholding a snarl.

I sink lower into my funk.  I'm now totally at effect.  In
complete overwhelm.

“Weell - what do you know!  - there is a whole package of service
facs here, they are - he lists out several - he quickly runs them -
the tone arm begins to blow down - the needle swings free - he starts
to brighten up.

He then begins to re-align several of his previous items and GPM
goals.

Talk about operating in uncharted, unmapped territory.  I didn't
know half of what he was covering.  I just wanted out of there.
Suddenly the room went almost completely dark.  I thought a cloud had
gone across the sun.  I reached over to turn on the lamp on the desk,
only it was on.

The blackness was being generate by him.  He started laughing.
“Wow!  I sure got this area in a mess.  This set belong here and this
set belong with this goal, this serv fac belongs to this GPM.  These
items are not my items!”

He ran chains of harmful acts in seconds.

The blackness just dissolved.

I asked: “How is your headache?”

“Better.” “Okay if we end here?” he asked.

Sure.” I answered.  (THANK GOD!!!)

The session lasted about 45 minutes, though to me it seemed like
an eternity.  To me this session was a total disaster.  This was
before the days of locate and indicate.  I had evaluated, put the
clients attention on the meter.  Gone totally weak valence.  Turned
session control over to the client.  Let the client end session on his
own determinism.  Gone into uncharted, unmapped territory.

He asked me to come back the same time tomorrow as he had a 3.45
appointment.

I agreed, of course.

That night he gave a lecture.  Just before he started the
lecture, he looked at me, tapped his head, smiled and made a circle
with his finger and thumb, indicating he was okay.

For me I was in a complete funk.  I was completely accessed.

What had happened?

I had run into more knowledge, velocity of force and charge than
I was willing to handle or for that matter capable of handling.

The client was able to run his case far better and deeper than I
could process.

Now I had to meet him again.

## THE NEXT MEETING

Again he greeted me warmly.  This time he went straight to
business.  He wanted me to graduate.

I said, “I'd love to but I hadn't gotten what I came for.  The
ability and certainty to process anyone, at anytime, on anything.”

He was somewhat taken aback by this.  We talked some more.  He
asked how the research we were doing on the Heletrobus Implants.

I answered: “There are quite a number of off-beat implants in
that area that are interfering with handling the area.”

“Such as?” he asked.  I told him.

He nodded okay.  Then reached for the meter and cans, handing me
the cans.

He gently said: “Start of Session.”

It was then I was hit with the most amazing, vast, powerful,
effective communication cycle I had ever experienced.

It contained the three attributes:

1.  Dynamic presence.

2.  Caring.

3.  Friendliness.

The four intentions:

1.  The willingness to have the client win big.  (Helping the
client to be able to own more and more of itself, its own universe and
all aspects of the games they are playing.)

2.  The willingness to know all, and turn on fully, all the force
and charge..

3.  The willingness to permeate all, plus to help the client as
needed to erase the unwanted force and charge.

4.  The willingness to let the client have full and complete
ownership of their own wins.

As his communication cycle impinged on me.  I could see my tone
arm, it started at 2.8, as soon as that communication cycle hit me,
the tone arm started soaring.  It shot up to 6.5 and the needle stuck
solid.

He gently asked: “What did you just look at?”

I hummed and oohed around, to be honest I didn't really know.  I
mumbled “its some huge mass.

“Tell me about it?”

So I described it.  Big, black, highly charged.

“Any idea what it contains?”

I started laughing.  “Yeah!  All the unconfronted masses and
charge from the processing I've had over the years.” The mass just
started to disintegrate.  My tone arm blew down to the 3.0 range and
the needle went free..

I itsa-ed: “The problem I ran into was the processors couldn't
confront the force, charge and masses.”

It was years later I realized that his communication cycle
allowed the full force, charge and masses to come to view and run out.

He ended the session.  We chatted some more.  He okayed my
staying on the briefing course until I achieved my goals of processing
anyone, at anytime, on anything.

## A NEW LEVEL OF EXCELLENCE AND MASTERY

Instead of being empowered by this experience, I came away very
overwhelmed.  The level of force and charge I was willing to handle
left much to be improved upon.

What was more embarrassing was the fact, at that time I was one
of the highest trained processors in the world, plus all my
co-processing was with the best of the best.  If I had not have
received such a demonstration of mastery and competence, I would still
be in a state of “I didn't know, I didn't know.” That meeting set a
whole new level of excellence and mastery of what was needed to have a
masterful communication cycle.

The was a vast difference between his communication cycle and
mine.  Mine was like a little squiggly line and his was an 80 lane
highway that could comfortably take any force or charge along it.
More than that his intention was to know all.

But what impressed me the most was his intention for me to win
big.

It is the communication cycle that is the basic reason that
causes processing to work.  If the communication cycle is faulty or
weak, the charge and force cannot be dissipated.  What makes this so
difficult to observe or correct is that it is a telepathically
projected 3 dimensional holographic spiritual manifestation.

With a masterful communication cycle in place, processes
magically work.  If it is faulty too much force, charge and mass will
be by-passed.  If this faulty communication cycle goes on too long the
client will build up too much by-passed and unhandled force, charge
and mass and will be difficult to get in session or will quit getting
processed altogether.

The resultant by-passed and unhandled force, charge and mass will
compress the beings ability to create and control space, and time into
a tiny area sometimes as small as a dot, thus effectively inhibiting
its ability to Be - Do - or Have in present time.  This compression
phenomena is not tangible, it usually manifests in having little or no
time, no space, no reach, no wins in life and living.

The best way to remedy this condition is to rehabilitate the
beings communication cycle.  That takes effective processing and
excellent training.
