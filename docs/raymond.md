The clearing community and mankind lost a very valuable contributor, mentor
and leader on June 1, 1998.

I first met Raymond in late August 1962 when he and I enrolled on the Saint
Hill Special Briefing Course. This was the beginning of a 35 plus years
friendship.

We co-processed together and did much of the Goals, Problems, Mass research
for LRH.

Over the years Raymond was an outstanding pioneer, leader and great
contributor in creating the general acceptance of the subject of clearing
and personal coaching. He was willing to share any of his successful
actions with his fellow practitioners, as recently as 5 weeks ago he called
me to share some of his findings on an area I was working on.

I will miss him and his helpful guidance.

But Raymond was far more than a masterful clearing practitioner.
