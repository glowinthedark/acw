## THE DEMANDS OF BY-PASSED CHARGE HANDLING

By-Passed Charge handling is possibly the most adroit of the people
handling skills.
It is not for wimps or lurkers. Spectators need not apply. Do it to
me'ers can forget about it.

Only those willing to take charge, willing to lose all, willing to risk
all, willing to be fully responsible should attempt By-Passed Charge
handling.

Handling By-Passed Charge is the ultimate processor skill and requires
the strongest
basics.

It also requires great certainty of who you are, plus the ability
to adopt ANY identity that will act as an opposite to the identity the
being is stuck in. The pc is in a Created As A Pre-Programmed
(by the By-Passed Charge) Synthetic You (This is the current false
identity that
the pc believes they are, and all of their friends and acquaintances,
and the culture is constantly solidly agreeing upon.)

Free Zone handling of By-Passed Charge is very different than what an
Organization
handles. Organizations have all sorts of containers of By-Passed Charge
in place and
solidly agreed upon.

Most Organizations composite mood levels cannot encompass or span the
spectrums of the scales needed to fully handle most areas of By-Passed
Charge.

Where-as the FreeZone is almost boundary-less. This means the coming
explosion as the being who has been encased in By-Passed Charge for
eons, and has been dramatizing some humanoid devoid of spirit identity,
which places the being below the Red Zone or absent, can be very loud
and violent as the being travels back up the scales. Often roaring up
the
Zones and scales like a freight train.

The Processor must be able to skip upwards through several hundred
instant created gradient identities. (Each, slightly bigger than the
pc's.)

The By-Passed Charge Processor is always slightly bigger than the pc,
until the pc is able to be themselves. This is the point the itsa-maker
line begins to go in and the pc is greater than their case.

A lot of people do this sequence:

1. Search.

2. Find.

3. Signify.

4. Verify.

As a matter of natural action. Any master of a game or skill naturally
observes their area of expertise and will put that which is out of
order back into its proper place until their ideals are attained.

Step 1. Is SEARCH.

Search for what? The correctness of who, what, when, where, why, how,
intention, mood level, etc.

For a processor the first observation is based upon: What do we have
here?

Is the who PRESENT? (Spiritual Being)

If yes, great!

If not: Then what is here?

Usually it is a fixed identity.

We will use as an example: A hater identity. (A being who
thinks, believes and has been convinced that this is HIM.)

How do you know this? He can't be the identity or not be the
identity at will.

It looks something like this:

In the Red Zone, one of the ATTRIBUTES is "works against." So the flow
coming at you tells you instantly where to look. The pc has usually been

in this identity for so long they have no idea that there is a
difference. All their operating machinery, communication devices are set

on "oppose mode."

An aware Spiritual Being has power of choice over what mode they want.

They can easily and comfortably "work against" Red Zone, "work for"
Yellow Zone or "work with" Green Zone at will.

For a session to work you need YOU and the PC to "work with," able to
hold a position while YOU guide the PC to inspect what it is wanted or
not wanted.

A PC trapped in By-Passed Charge cannot inspect or separate
themselves from the "unwanted condition or identity."

They are being "a HIM that is not HIM." Kind of a big lie!

The FIND step: PC appears to hate everyone and everything.

A truly good By-Passed Charge processor will usually need to SIGNIFY
only one
indication.

i.e.. HATEFUL aren't we! It can be tossed off as a sneering "make
nothing
of" comment. As that is the only type of communication a Red Zoner can
receive. The PC will instantly begin to make more of themselves, as they

are "working against" the processor. But to do that, they to a degree
have to separate from what they are being.

If it is the correct indication, the VERIFICATION will be the PC able to

communicate about that. Usually the PC will quickly go upscale,
traveling the different Zones gradients swiftly.

The Processor goes upscale with them shifting from "make nothing" to
"make less" to "make more of" the PC and less of the condition.

What you as a processor want to create is MOTION from
the PC, then MOTION to and from the case. Mainly undelivered
communications, protests, unexpressed resentments, evil
intentions, etc.

A PC who is buried under By-Passed Charge is IMPLODED
into being created and contained as a DOT.

A PC who suddenly lets loose an EXPLOSION of force, mass,
and charge is in actuality de-DOT-ing itself, It is re-emerging as
a PRESENCE. The force, mass, violence and charge that
appears to be getting thrown in your direction is the PC emerging
and taking charge of their own universe.

As the PC expresses these, they begin to separate from them.

```
>>>>YOU...>>>.........><.............<<<A Hater<<
O O O O O O O.........><.............X pc X X evil X
O.....................O.........><.............X X charge X X

O.....................O.........><.............Xpc X X hate X
O.....................O.........><.............X X charge X X
O O O O O O O.........><.............X evil X X pc X
```

Order is being put into chaos. The force, charge and masses
connected to hatred begins to look something like this:

```
...YOU>>>>........>>..........>>>A Friend....>>Situation

.......YOU<<<<<<<<<Itsa-Maker-Line<<<<<<<<<
```

A very Green Zone. YOU and the PC are "working with" each other.

The By-Passed Charge Processor acts as a 3 dimensional
holographic operational model, the PC will attempt to do
an exact 3 dimensional holographic operational
model duplicate of the Processor and their eductive communication
cycle.

The basic truth is the Processor can just hold a position
silently, if the 1st indication:  "HATEFUL aren't we!" Is correct.

It is quite magical to behold.

The fact is, being able to Search, Find, Signify, and Verify is all
there is to Marketing. Dissemination and Sales.

What messes these subjects up are the attempt to impose your own or the
group wants onto the public. This acts as a wrong indication and creates

By-Passed Charge.

By-Passed Charge handling demands that you Search, Find, Signify, and
Verify what is in front of you.

Wanting to take over the world is not very real to most public
individuals. They have "unsolvable problem wants" like: How come I keep
getting more and more in debt? How do I win at this game I'm in? What am

I going to do for the future? How come my partner and I are always
fighting? They just keep getting wrong answers to these questions, thus
creating more and more By-Passed Charge on themselves and those around
them.

It is terribly embarrassing to see a "top level processor" without
clients. It is an instant indicator of processing a false present time,
an
inability to Search, Find, Signify, and Verify correctly that leads
handling the By-Passed Charge.

You don't have to sell: = You just Search, Find, Signify, and Verify
correctly. A couple of correct indications and the person will want
more.

But for Christ sake! Search, Find, Signify, and Verify the case in front

of you.

## FIND WHAT THEY WANT.

## FIND WHAT IS STOPPING THEM FROM GETTING THEIR WANTS.

It doesn't have to be spot on, and if your wrong, just apologize. The
apology will usually blow the By-Passed Charge you just created.

By-Passed Charge handling is for ALL levels of existence's.
