## METER RESPONSES AND BY-PASSED CHARGE

There is possibly more false data, false significance, stupidity and
confusion connected to the role and use of a meter. Especially in
dealing with By-Passed Charge.

Where there are heavy areas of BY-PASSED CHARGE, there are heavy UPSETS.

Meters do not read well in areas of heavy UPSETS.

Sometimes the client can be so overcharged that the meter will give a
reverse response.

When a processor is observing a meter in action they are observing the
flows of energy along certain lines or pathways.

The current flowing from one electrode to the other is setting up an
ARTIFICIAL FLOW OF ENERGY THAT CAUSES A MINUSCULE WALL OF CROSS ENERGY ACROSS THE CLIENT TO PROCESSOR - OR FROM CLIENT TO THE KNOWINGLY FOCUSED OR STUCK POINT OF ATTENTION.

The ENERGY FLOW looks something like this:
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O~~~~~Processor Presence~~~~~~O
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O~~~Processor to Client flow line~~O
O>>>>>>>>intentions<<<<<<<<<O
O.......v...........v.......^...........^.........O
O.......v...........v.......^...........^.........O

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O~~~~~~Clients Presence~~~~~~O
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

The flow of energy between the client and processor is going through an
artificial barrier created by the current or energy flowing through the
electrodes.

What the needle is showing is the points of change or no change of these
cross conflicting flows.

All a change of needle manifestation means is something changed on that
METER FLOW LINE.

In the presence of an effective eductive comm. and F/N, and Green Zone
Truth Phenomena:

## OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O~~~~~~Processor Presence~~~~~O
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O~~Processor to Client flow line ~~O
O>>>>>>>>intentions<<<<<<<<<O
O.......v...........v.......^...........^.........O

Persistent Floating Needle with Cause Indicators, with nothing in
present time impeding the clients attainments of wants and intentions.

By erasing these charged areas

```
.v........v.....v............v............v....
.case..ptp..w/h.....upset...spouse..
>>charge>>>charge<<charge<<<
>>mass>><<mass>><<mass<<<
>>force>><<force>><<force<<<
>>charge>>>charge<<charge<<<
```

you have eliminated much of what has been causing a low mood
level, areas that have slowed, stopped or prevented the being from
reaching out and attaining their wants and intentions.

## THE USE OF INDICATORS AND THE METER

By utilizing the Green Zone Truth Phenomena and the various meter
manifestations the processor has some very potent tools. But these tools
require that the processor maintains the highest levels of honor,
responsibility and integrity in regards the use of these tools. For the
meter can become a very destructive tool in the hands of a dishonorable,
low responsibility and low integrity processor.

## METER DEPENDENCY

Possible the worse case scenario a processor can run into is the client
who is so unsure of themselves that they continuously ask: ï¿½What did the
meter say?ï¿½

This is a sign this poor client has been processed by a processor that
used the meter to invalidate the clients data or originationï¿½s.

Other clients react negatively, when the processor says: ï¿½ Lets do a
review of this area?ï¿½ The client immediately plunges down scale. This
indicates the constant past invalidation and false indications on the
meter.

The meter under these circumstances is a liability, the effective
processor usually uses only direct indicators to guide them in what to
process.

The competent, effective processor mainly uses the meter to verify the
end phenomena of the process, preferring to process the client directly
in front of them. Using the clients interest and change of moods to
direct them on what to process.

The meter can lead a processor easily astray. I know of dozens of cases
that have been ruined because of high tone arms, yet had the processors
just observed the client in front of them, they would have noticed the
client was making great progress even though the tone arm was running
high.

The true test for ANY processing is: HOW IS THE CLIENT DOING IN LIFE.

When the eductive communication cycle is operable in the session the
client WILL make gains.

Using the meter in such a way as to destroy a clients eductive
communication cycle can have serious long term consequences.

Poorly trained processors who do not know their scales or the basics of
processing have the greatest chance of using the meter as a destructive
control device.

One of the most important aspects of processing is to recover the
clients ability to be certain of their ability to observe what is. That
requires the correct use of the meter and observation of indicators.

## THE PROCESSES OF LIFE

Every process has a complete cycle of action.

## EVERY PROCESS HAS A COMPLETE CYCLE OF ACTION.

And just in case you missed this:

## EVERY PROCESS HAS A COMPLETE CYCLE OF ACTION.

All processes span the spectrum of ALL scales.

It is immaterial what the process is, it will span the spectrum of the
scales.

The spectrum ranges from the bottom of the Red Zone - ABSENCE to the top
of the Green Zone - MASTERY.

At ABSENCE the area is being denied, not-ised or no contact.

At MASTERY the client can mock up the end phenomena of the process or
unmock it at will. This is done at a level of Spirit of Play.

Someone who is failing at life is someone who has not taken their life
processes to MASTERY. They are dramatizing incomplete processes.

To truly effectively process someone you must find what their prime
processes of life are and help them attain mastery on them. As they
continue towards achieving their goals then all the other sub-goals,
skills, abilities, virtues and codes come into play.

ALL of a beings or groups Goals, Dreams, Purposes, or Wants ARE
beginning PROCESSES and PROCEDURES. Upsets, problems, withholds, harmful
acts, skills, abilities, knowledge, literacy, etc. are by-products
connected to the journey of attaining those Goals, Dreams, Purposes and
Wants PROCESSES and PROCEDURES.

Achievement of the beings or groups Goals, Dreams, Purposes, or Wants
ARE the end product of those PROCESSES and PROCEDURES.

When processing impedes the attainment of a beings or groups Goals,
Dreams, Purposes or Wants PROCESSES and PROCEDURES then you are in an
area of major by-passed charge and this must be cleared.

An OT is being who can knowingly mock up or unmock the beings or groups
Goals, Dreams, Purposes, or Wants PROCESSES and PROCEDURES sequences and
produce the end phenomenaï¿½s at will.
