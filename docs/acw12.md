Over the years certain pieces of data have a workability that is truly
awesome.

The recognition and use of making "nothing of" - "less of" - "more of,"
can give insights into the true direction of yourself or other in life
or an area.

"making nothing of" is a Red Zone characteristic. Thus tends to be very
destructive. Low havingness

"making less of" is a Yellow Zone characteristic. Thus tends to be
mediocre.

"making more of" is a Green Zone characteristic. Thus tends to be
expansionary and creative. High havingness.

These are also great childrens games to play.

### EXERCISE 1

Communication Recognition

The objective of this exercise is to increase the Student's ability to
perceive and recognize whether a person is making more of, less of, or
nothing of him.

Each question or command that has "you" in it is to be prefaced with
either "As a spiritual being, . . ." or "As a god-like being, . . ." or
"As a (prime identity),....".

Section 1:  The coach asks:

1.	"What is your comprehension of Communication Recognition?"
Student answers.  Coach writes down answers.

2.	Take each answer from Step #1 and ask:
"Have you ever done that?"
Student answers.  If just a "yes" say:
"Tell me about it."  Get the student to tell all about it.
Repeat Step #2 on each answer from Step #1.

3.	"What precepts do you have about Communication Recognition?"

4.	Continue Clean Slate Handling to Cause Indicators.

Section 2:

After giving the command to demonstrate the ability wanted, the Coach
delivers a communication that either makes more of, less of, or nothing
of the Student, e.g.:  his actions, his body, his clothes, something he
said, etc. 

The Student perceives what is being said and the intention behind it
and tells the Coach whether the communication was making more, less or
nothing of him.  If the Student correctly spots the communication type,
Coach acknowledges and gives a new communication.

If the Student incorrectly names the communication type, Coach informs
Student of this and repeats the exact same communication in the exact
same manner.

Coach should start out with specific communications that make more,
less or nothing of the Student.  Coach then works up to more general or
covert answers that hide the communication type.  The purpose is to
increase the Student's ability to the level where he can recognize these
communication types in any conversation he may encounter in life.

Coach says:

1.	"Demonstrate to me masterful Communication Recognition."  Student
does this.

2.	"What did you do?"  Student answers.

3.	"Did that trigger anything?"  Student answers.  If just yes, say: 
"Tell me about it."

4.	“Is there an unpleasant sensation?”  If so, get it named and ask:

5.	“From where could a spiritual being experience (named unpleasant
sensation)?  	Repeat to Cause Indicators.

6.	“From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant
sensation)?  Repeat 
to Cause Indicators.

7.	Coach then repeats step 1 having student demonstrate the ability for
longer and longer 	periods before going on to question 2.

If at any point during this the student has a physical manifestation
immediately ask an appropriate De-Access Question and have Student tell
about it briefly.  Then repeat step 1 and have the student continue the
exercise for the set time period.

This exercise is continued until the Student has certainty in spotting
correctly the type of communication being delivered.  Student and Coach
then switch roles and repeat this exercise.

> MORE OF — LESS OF — NOTHING OF

### EXERCISE 2 - Presenting Bad News

The objective of this exercise is to teach the Student how to present
bad news so that it can be easily accepted and made less of by the
receiver.

Section 1:  The coach asks:

1.	"What is your comprehension of Presenting Bad News?"
Student answers.  Coach writes down answers.

2.	Take each answer from Step #1 and ask:
"Have you ever done that?"
Student answers.  If just a "yes" say:
"Tell me about it."  Get the student to tell all about it.
Repeat Step #2 on each answer from Step #1.

3.	"What precepts do you have about Presenting Bad News?"

4.	Continue Clean Slate Handling to Cause Indicators.

Section 2:

When the Coach asks the Student to demonstrate the ability wanted, the
Student responds by telling the Coach an exaggerated, "make more of"
story about some bad news.  This story is to be truthful and told with
sincerity. the lead in is to be exaggerated to prepare the Coach for
something as bad or worse than the news, thus preventing the Coach from
being shocked by the news.

EXAMPLE:  Student:  "I don't know how to tell you about this.  I've
agonized all night and I've been terrified to call you, but your ______
and we ______  God, I feel real bad about this", etc.

Coach responds in the manner in which he feels compelled to respond. 
If the Student's exaggerated story is believable and sufficiently makes
more of the bad news the Coach would feel compelled to make less of the
bad news.  If this is not the case, Coach should respond how he feels he
should.

Coach says:

1.	"Demonstrate to me masterful Presenting Bad News."  Student does
this.

2.	"What did you do?"  Student answers.

3.	"Did that trigger anything?"  Student answers.  If just yes, say:
"Tell me about it."

4.	“Is there an unpleasant sensation?”  If so, get it named and ask:

5.	“From where could a spiritual being experience (named unpleasant
sensation)?  	Repeat to Cause Indicators.

6.	“From where could a spiritual being create (named unpleasant
sensation)?  Repeat to Cause Indicators.

7.	Coach then repeats step 1 having student demonstrate the ability for
longer and longer periods before going on to question 2.

If at any point during this the student has a physical manifestation
immediately ask an appropriate De-Access Question and have Student tell
about it briefly.  Then repeat step 1 and have the student continue the
exercise for the set time period.

This is done over and over until Student feels very comfortable with
presenting bad news and is consistently getting the Coach to make less
of the bad news.

> MORE OF — LESS OF — NOTHING OF

### EXERCISE 3 - Handling "Nothing Of"

The objective of this exercise is to teach the Student to be able to

of
something by making more of it?"

4.	Continue Clean Slate Handling to Cause Indicators.

Section 2:

After giving the command to demonstrate the ability wanted, the Coach
comments on something he doesn't like about the Student.

EXAMPLE:  Coach says to Student, after observing that he has bad skin,
"You have a really bad complexion!"  Student demonstrates the ability
wanted by making more of what the Coach said, e.g. "I know.  Isn't it
terrible?  Have you any idea how much anxiety I've had over this?  Why
I've spent ________."

The Student is doing this properly when the Coach no longer has his
attention on what he was making nothing of.

Coach says:

1.	"Demonstrate to me masterful handling an attempt to make nothing of
something by making more of it."  Student does this.

2.	"What did you do?"  Student answers.

3.	"Did that trigger anything?"  Student answers.  If just yes, say:

sensation)?  
Repeat	to Cause Indicators.

longer and longer 	periods before going on to question 2.

If at any point during this the student has a physical manifestation
immediately ask an appropriate De-Access Question and have Student tell
about it briefly.  Then repeat step 1 and have the student continue the
exercise for the set time period.

This is done until the Student can comfortably confront all those
things about himself that he wished were NOTHING and can consistently
unfix the Coach’s attention from what he was making nothing of.
