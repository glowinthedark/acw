Anyone seeking a better life through increased knowledge is part
of the knowledge era.

The subject of Knowledgism derives from the coming era.

It is not just a spiritual philosophy, hopefully it includes the
mastery of all subjects that greatly enhances life for each of us.

## WHAT IS KNOWLEDGISM?

Knowledgism is the high-tech, high-touch use of knowledge
systems, processes and procedures to optimize economies, societies,
areas, subjects, objects, groups, and individuals, and to help their
utilization's, quality and viability for the greatest good of all.  It
is based on win-win accomplishment for all, and includes that which is
best from past systems.

As Knowledgism expands it will cross national boundaries and
those of race, color, and creed.

A Knowledgist studies, practices and applies knowledge for the
greatest good of everyone.  Knowledge has become not only the power of
today's society, but the basis for survival in the future.  In the
coming years, the rewards for being knowledgeable will be vast; the
penalties for ignorance, severe.

## THE KNOWLEDGE ERA

8000 YEARS OF MOSTLY-FORWARD PROGRESS

An evolution of paradigms is always in progress.  Those who stay
on top of the changes find themselves in the right place at the right
time, changing to new paradigms as old ones become less viable.  Those
who

cannot keep up with the change, or who have a vested interest in
the old ways, fight and oppose change and get left behind.

The first trend on the chart is the Evolution of Knowledge
Cycles.  This trend shows the learning paradigm shifts that mankind
has gone through.  The period from 6000 B.C.  to 400 A.D.  was the
basic Warrior Era where man, nations, groups, and relationships were
alternately conquered, dominated, subjugated, and forced to comply
with the will of others.  This was the prevailing paradigm of the day.

The years from 400 A.D.  to 1000 A.D.  were the Dark Ages.  Man
lost his desire to learn and opposed knowledge.  This was a time of
paradigm crash.

"It wasn't until a thousand years later that we find 'reckoning
masters' teaching pupils bound for commercial careers."

## THE LITERACY ERA

The years from 1000 A.D.  to the present are the Literacy Era.
Another paradigm shift took place during this time as an almost
world-wide activity of learning to read, write, and do arithmetic was
being pursued.

In less than 1000 years, a major period of paradigm upgrading,
man has seen his entire universe shift to higher and higher levels of
survival and abundance.  His life span has almost doubled.  Food,
shelter, and basic survival needs are more than adequate for 90% of
the literate nations' populations.

## THE KNOWLEDGE ERA

With knowledge the primary source of power, the 1990's and the
21st

century will become the Knowledge Era.

Today, with our ability to record knowledge and skills on a
memory chip, the innovation of smart, skilled machines will
revolutionize the industrial countries.  It's entirely possible that
by the year 2020, we could see the type of change in industry that
occurred in agriculture, leaving only a few percent producing what 90%
had produced previously.  What

will this mean for you?  What will you need to know and be in
order to stay in the mainstream and keep winning?  How can you benefit
from the changes to improve your success, prosperity, and happiness?

Obviously, the technological elite, as well as people-handling
skills (not just for the sick and elderly but for the young and able),
will be in great demand.  As we move into the Knowledge Era, the
successful paradigms

will be knowledge-based.
