Homer, what locks the Collapsed Universe in place is pain. Pain is a
composite of heat, cold, electicity, and unpleasant sensations.

By handling each piece separately, the pain begins to vanish, the causes the
rest of the area to come to view.

This is easy does it processing. Best run to a win, break, to a win break, etc.

Meters aren't much good as they tend to read late or not at all, best follow
your interest.

It looks complex, but its fairly easy to follow.

Sometimes you may have to go over area a few times, just follow your interest.

Make sure you ack. any wins.
