The great thing about these handles are, they handle what the pc
is sitting in, in PT.

My certainty is that this is the point most Scio processes stop.
Just before the Shock, Confusion, Mass, Force could really turn on.

Lots of pcs come into session sitting in these, so anything other
than locating them, indicating them, and then handling them will screw
up a case until they are adressed.

Any processing just beefs them up.

These Shocks, Confusions,Masses, or Forces occur outside the
physical universe.  So it requires Being somewhat Godlike to handle
it.  This outlaws an identity trying to be the Auditor.

I'm sure you and Jane can do this.  It is quite magical as the
answers are right HERE in PT.

You and Jane may have lots of the above to handle, just take it
easy, do it as you feel like it.  Don't get into forcing yourselves.

Especially be aware of the Shocks that occured in Scio.  Like
when you first observed it wasn't what it pretended to be.  Thats one
of those "unthinkable thoughts." Definitely causes a Shock.

## SHOCK, CONFUSION, MASS AND FORCE HANDLING

These are the basic Shock, Confusion, Mass and Force Handling
sequences to be used in conjunction with the Intelligence and Ability
Restoration Procedure.

Unless contained within it, all questions and commands are to be
prefaced with either "As a spiritual being, ..." or "As a god-like
being, ....".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHOCK HANDLING SEQUENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 — "When did the shock occur?"

2 — "Where did the shock occur?"

3 — "Go to the moment of shock."

4 — "What is its size?"

5 — "What is its weight?"

6 — "What is its color?"

7 — "What is the duration of the shock?"

8 — "What are the frozen moods in the shock?"

9 — "Are there any intentions connected to the shock?" If "Yes,"
ask: "What are they?"

10 — "At that time what was it that must not be experienced?"

11 — "Prior to the shock, what were your dreams and aspirations
in the area?"

12 — "What was the want that preceded those dreams and
aspirations?"

13 — "How big were you when you had those wants, dreams and
aspirations?"

14 — "How big were you after the shock?"

15 — "Return to the moment of shock."

16 — "Permeate the shock, fully experience it and have it
dissipate into free life force."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Student cannot dissipate it, check for more moods, intentions
and must not be experienced items.  Then repeat Step #16.  If still
cannot dissipate, get the main mood or must not be experienced item
and run:

a.  "From where could a spiritual being experience (item)?" to
Cause Indicators; then:

b.  "From where could a spiritual being create (item)?"to Cause
Indicators.

Then repeat Step #16.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFUSION AND MASS HANDLING SEQUENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 — "Where is it?"

2 — "What is its size?"

3 — "What is its weight?"

4 — "What is its color?"

5 — "What are its moods?"

6 — "What is its duration?

7 — "What are its intentions?"

8 — "What about it must not be experienced?

9 — "Permeate it, fully experience it, and have it dissipate
into free life force."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Student cannot dissipate it, check for more moods, intentions
and must not be experienced items.  Then repeat Step #16.  If still
cannot dissipate, get the main mood or must not be experienced item
and run:

a.  "From where could a spiritual being experience (item)?" to
Cause Indicators; then:

b.  "From where could a spiritual being create (item)?"to Cause
Indicators.

Then repeat Step #9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FORCE HANDLING SEQUENCE

1.  "Where is it?"

2.  "Where did you experience the impact or feelings connected to
the force?"

3.  "What is its direction?"

4.  "What is its size?"

5.  "What is its weight or pressure?"

6.  "What is its velocity?"

7.  "What is its sensation?"

8.  "What is its color?"

9.  "What is its temperature?"

10.  "What are its moods?"

11.  "What is its duration?

12.  "What are its intentions?"

13.  "What about it must not be experienced?

14.  "Permeate it, fully experience it, and have it dissipate
into free life force."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Student cannot dissipate it, check for more moods, intentions
and must not be experienced items.  Then repeat Step #14.  If still
cannot dissipate it, get the main mood or must not be experienced item
and run:

"From where could a spiritual being experience (item)?" to Cause
Indicators; then: "From where could a spiritual being create (item)?"
to Cause Indicators.

Then repeat Step #14.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NOTE:

1 — If the shock, mass or force is connected to some
disreputable incident and does not easily resolve, you can check:

"Are there any pictures or creations in this shock/mass/force
that must not be known?"

Get all, then complete the shock, mass or force handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 — If after running all questions, including the "From where
..." questions, the shock, mass or force will not dissipate, ask:

"If this shock/mass/force were to vanish, what are you afraid you
would have to be responsible for?"

Get what it is and run Responsibility on it, then complete the
shock, mass or force handling..
