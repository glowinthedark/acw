PRACTICES, PRACTITIONERS AND CLIENTS MISDIRECTIONS, TRICKS, DENIALS AND AVOIDANCES, CONNECTED TO "THE FURIES"

"The Furies" have remained unhandled on all Spiritual Beings'
cases, because they contain huge powerful quantities of disruptive,
destructive psychic forces, charge, pain, fear and anguish, stemming
from violations of the Spiritual Beings' Codes, Virtues, Honesty,
Principles and Integrity.

When a Spiritual Being violates its Codes, Virtues, Honesty,
Principles and Integrity the being feels less worthy of the rewards of
life.  Too many violations and the Spiritual Being begins to HATE
itself; the more violations, the deeper and more far reaching the
HATRED OF SELF.

HATRED OF SELF causes a diminishment of self and power.  As the
being continues to violate its basic principles of honor, the being
diminishes itself into an ever smaller sphere of influence and has
less and less presence.  Should this cycle of diminishment continue
the being will actually disappear.  In its place are substitute
compression containers and identities.

This diminishment of the Spiritual Being is the equivalent to
DEATH, VANQUISHMENT and EXTINCTION of the SPIRIT, a very terrifying
cataclysmic event for the being.  So much so, the Spiritual Being will
do anything in order to survive and stay in existence.

As the Being cannot find the truth and correct answers to this
terrifying THREAT OF DEATH, VANQUISHMENT and EXTINCTION of the SPIRIT,
the Being will INVENT and CREATE WRONG ANSWERS, WRONG ITEMS and
IMPLEMENT WRONG SOLUTIONS in order to protect and defend itself from
this cataclysmic event.

Blame, shame, guilt, irresponsibility, domination, subjugation,
bitterness, anger, apathy, lying, etc., are all defensive mechanisms
in order to make themselves right and escape the DEATH and EXTINCTION
of the SPIRITUAL BEING.

"The Furies" are just such a defense mechanism.  In an attempt to
survive its spiritual VANISHMENT and EXTINCTION, the Being has to
actively and speedily deny its HATRED OF ITSELF.  To do this denial
the Being is forced to give up the TRUTH and resort to blaming others
for making them violate their Codes, Virtues, Principles, Honesty and
Integrity.

"The Furies" are a violent attempt to defend self and shift the
blame of violations onto others.

The Being has become a master at misdirection, tricks, denying,
and avoiding what violations preceded "The Fury." TRUTH becomes a
weapon of great THREAT of EXTINCTION for it causes the Being to
approach that which could cause the being to VANISH and become
EXTINCT.

The fact is, one of the effects of dramatizing "The Furies,"
causes the Being to make ALL of their CREATIONS EXTINCT.

The desperate solution to the problem of EXTINCTION, has now
become a much greater, more complex problem.

It is this THREAT OF EXTINCTION that has terrified and scared
away all practices, practitioners and client, from handling "The
Furies."

The problem for the Spiritual Being is not "The Furies," it is
what preceded "The Furies." The HATRED OF SELF and the VIOLATIONS OF ITS HONOR AND SELF WORTH.

You, therefore, have several areas that MUST BE FULLY HANDLED.

They are as follows:

1.  Locate and Handle Violations of Codes, Virtues, Principles,
Honesty and Integrity.

2.  Locate and Handle the THREATS OF EXTINCTION.

3.  Locate and Handle Massive HATRED OF SELF.

4.  Locate and Handle "THE FURY DIRECTED TOWARDS SELF."

5.  Locate and Handle the DENIAL OF RESPONSIBILITY, and the
MENTAL SHIFT TO BLAME OTHERS.  (The source point to becoming a
VICTIM.)

6.  Locate and handle the People, Places, Subjects and Things,
the Being has chosen to BLAME and SHAME.

7.  Locate and Handle the Construction of Instruments, Devices
and Machines to automatically enforce this BLAME and SHAME.

8.  Locate and Handle the Instruments, Devices and Mechanisms
used to obfuscate these BLAME and SHAME Instruments, Devices and
Machines.

9.  Locate and Handle the creating RAGE and FURY to direct at
OTHERS, in order to hide the HATRED OF SELF and to shift the BLAME and
SHAME on to OTHERS.

10.  Locate and Handle the justifications and rationalizations to
BLAME and SHAME OTHERS.

11.  Locate and Handle all the PSYCHIC CONTAINERS or BOXES, the
Being has implemented to Compressed or Restrained itself.

12.  Locate and Handle by continuing the rest of the Super Being
Power Prosperity Procedures.

## KINDLY AND GENTLY DOES IT!

It requires an incredibly safe, trustful processing team and
environment to process this technology, as the being is going up
against those areas which the Spiritual Being believes can cause it to
become EXTINCT.

What the Being has not realized is, they are already worse than
EXTINCT, they have become SOMEONE or SOMETHING ELSE.

They have long ago ceased being themselves.

## UNTIL THE FURIES ARE FULLY HANDLED, A KIND AND GENTLE APPROACH IS MANDATORY.

ABUSE keeps the THREAT OF EXTINCTION forever present.  This
forces the Being to become defensive which accesses them into the
distrustful, distant, cold, angryness of chronic RIGHTNESS, not the
warm, trusting, close, friendliness and purity of TRUTH.
