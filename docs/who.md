These are a great set of processes.

You could also include:

"Is an unimportance being made more of?"

By whom? get who.

>"Is a being being made nothing of?" Who?

"Is an identity being made more of?" who?

>"Is a lie being made nothing of?" Who?

"Is a truth being made nothing of?" Who?

"Is a lie being made more of?" Who?

"Is a truth being made more of?" Who?

Take each who and run:

What problem has......who.... given you?

How have you solved it?

What have been the consequencess of that solution?

What problem have you given.....Who......?

How did they solve it?

What have been the consequences of that solution?

This would blow a huge chunk of ABUSE and WRONG ITEMS out of your space.
