This would be an excellent point to do clay table healing.

It would be very beneficial if you laid out the sequence of the above in
clay.

I do not have the clay table healing commands, but someone can post
them.

I have had tremendous wins on straightening out masses entities and
lines to me while doing this.

Just spotting the masses entities and lines blows a lot of charge.

BTW masses are usually held together by an unwilling to experience
picture, feeling, sensation or incident.

It also puts space and time between the masses and entities.

It definitely puts the CEO in charge.
