Dear Ron and Denise,

Thank you for your heartfelt support.  I am happy to report that my client
is "still on cloud nine) (not drug induced!!) 

Today when she arrived for session and I asked her what she wanted to
handle to today, she told me that she was so-o-o- happy.  And doing
s-o-o-good that she just wanted to do something positive. 

So we studied and discussed the tape Miracles and Magic, and let her
continue to enjoy her wins from her last processing.  (Miracles and Magic
covers the area of Spiritual Teammates.) 

What is so amazing to me about these processes is that you can process
someone who has absolutely no clue about their spirituality nor any
education on the subject and it still works. 

During listening to the tape, she would say things like ,oh, yeah, that's
what happened to me in session yesterday. 

Today she realized more about herself as a spiritual being and discovered
spiritual teammates with a big smile on her face. 

It was a good day.  Tomorrow she is spending with her family, testing the
waters. 

Monday it is back in session. 

Thank you all again for your love and support. 

Love,

Marlene
