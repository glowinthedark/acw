## POL POT IS DEAD

Pol Pot was born into a farming family in Kompong Thom province,
80 miles north of Phnom Penh.  Personal details of his life were
always hard to verify, and only in his 1997 interview did he make
public the true year of his birth, 1925.

Pol Pot went to Paris in 1949 on a government scholarship to
study electronics.  Absorbed with leftist politics, he established a
communist cell with fellow Cambodian students.  He failed his exams,
lost his scholarship and returned home.

Society was to be "purified," Khmer Rouge officials said.  The
country began a forced march to pure agrarian communism â€” cities were
emptied, money was abolished, nationwide communal kitchens introduced,
schools and temples shut.

Phnom Penh was evacuated at gunpoint and its 2 million people
sent to work in the countryside.

Marked for death were educated people, religious or ethnic
minorities, Buddhist monks, and anyone suspected of ties with the
former government or who questioned the regime.

Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, whom the Khmer Rouge deposed,
recently described Pol Pot as "one of the most powerful monsters ever
created by humanity."

This has a familiar sequence to it:

When David Miscavige took over the CofS he instituted a similar
policy as Pol Pot.

Pol Pot's operating basis.

"Marked for death were educated people, religious or ethnic
minorities, Buddhist monks, and anyone suspected of ties with the
former government or who questioned the regime."

DM's operating basis.

Marked for elimination were the highest trained, most experienced
and knowledgeable staff, those who could originate, those who ran
their own centers and those who had previous ties to LRH and the
original Orgs.

Make no mistake about this: The last thing DM wants are OT's.
